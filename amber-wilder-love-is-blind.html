I was just so not appreciated, and I don't ever want to get to that point again, you know?” Amber said on the series. “I don't want to have to burn myself out loving somebody just getting scraps in return. I don't want a repeat of that. So I put time and effort into thinking about what I want for the future and I'm so ready."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At this time, Amber has been relatively quiet about the identities of her ex-husbands.

After living the single life for three years, she wants to “find my person that sees me for me.” She’s seeking an “intelligent and confident” guy with a nice smile who can be her “travel buddy” during her layovers for work. Amber won’t put up with anyone who is “messy and selfish.” But, if she does find her Mr. Right, get ready, because she says, “When I care about you, I care BIG."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Initially, Amber made a connection with Paul Peden.
