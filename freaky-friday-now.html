Hard to believe it's been 15 years since Freaky Friday was released in theaters, but the iconic Disney film is celebrating its anniversary on Aug. 6. The film catapultedLindsay Lohan into teen stardom, and it was one of the few movie remakes to be just as good (if not a little better) than the original."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She's currently the owner of Lohan Nightclub in Greece and recently shot a pilot for a reality show about her new life as a club owner. And if you're wondering how seriously she's taking her new role as a club owner, that answer is "very seriously." She recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">threatened to fire</a> employees at her club for not wearing matching shoes.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Lindsay has reinvented herself abroad, most people in the States still remember her for her trashy history, which Lindsay thinks everyone should get over.</p><p>“There’s a business side to my life now, but I’m not in America, so no one knows about it, which is nice for me," she recently told Wendy Williams on her show. "Because I get to actually focus on the result of things,” the star said. “I’m a normal, nice person. A good person. I don’t have any bad intentions. And my past has to stay in the past. Like, people have to just let go of it and stop bringing it up because it’s not—it’s gone. It’s dead. And that’s the most important thing to me."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jamie Lee Curtis (Tess)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>Now 59, <a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis</a> is still hard at work, appearing in TV shows like Scream Queens and New Girl. She's also returning to her iconic role as Laurie Strode in the new Halloween movie.</p><p>“Laurie Strode is the greatest part I’ll ever get to play," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said </a>at this year's San Diego Comic Con. "The idea that ... when I was 19 years old on the streets of Los Angeles we made this movie … and now 40 years later we’re at Comic Con announcing a new movie in 2018, it is mind-blowing, and I am privileged.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chad Michael Murray (Jake)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>Fun fact: Lindsay's on-screen kiss with <a href=#>Chad Michael Murray </a>was her first kiss ever. Aww! After playing Anna's hunky love interest, Chad went on to appear in all kinds of things, although most notably, One Tree Hill. He currently has two movies in production and recently appeared in the TV show Sun Records.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mark Harmon (Ryan)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>He played Tess' fiancé in the movie, and apparently had himself frozen since then because he looks exactly the same. These days, Mark, who's now 66, is investigating crime cases as Leroy on NCIS.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christina Vidal (Maddie)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>She played Anna's friend and bandmate who performed the iconic <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Take Me Away</a>." Cool fact: The role was initially offered to Kelly Osbourne, but she turned it down because she didn't want to star in a "children's movie." The part was then offered to Christina who snagged the role after only one audition.</p><p>Since then, the 36-year-old has appeared in several TV shows, from Blue Bloods to Training Day. She's currently starring in Amazon's Sneaky Pete.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryan Malgarini (Harry)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>It's hard to believe, but the kid who played Anna's brother is now 26! He hasn't been too active since the movie, but according to his IMDb page, he's been appearing in small roles on TV shows like Fresh Off the Boat and Teen Wolf.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Julie Gonzalo (Stacey)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>She spent most of the early '00s playing the "pretty mean girl," in both Freaky Friday and A Cinderella Story. However, these days, the 36-year-old mostly appears in heartwarming Hallmark movies like Pumpkin Pie Wars and The Sweetest Heart.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Haley Hudson (Peg)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>She played Tess' other friend and bandmate and, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Christina</a>, was the only actress on the set who learned how to play guitar just for the movie. After Freaky Friday, she appeared in various TV shows and a horror movie franchise, The Pact. However, she hasn't appeared in anything since 2014, and the picture above is from 2013. With no social media presence, her current whereabouts are a mystery.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stephen Tobolowsky (Mr. Bates)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>No teen movie is complete without a nerdy teacher, and Stephen has spent most of his career playing them (along with doctors and professors). He most recently was in The Goldbergs where he played (you guessed it) a principal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rosalind Chao (Pei-Pei)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images, Casual Friday Productions</span></figure><p>Although she had a small part in the film, she played the pivotal role of the owner of the Chinese restaurant where Tess and Anna eat magical fortune cookies that make them switch bodies (a plot point that still makes us roll our eyes for being both dumb and racially insensitive). Anyway, today, the 60-year-old actress appears in the TV show Code Black.</p><p>Who's ready for a Freaky Friday reunion?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">More from Distractify</h2><p><a href=#>Can You Guess Which Makeup-Less Celeb Is Actually Still Wearing Makeup?</a></p><p><a href=#>32 Movie Mistakes That Will Absolutely Ruin Your Favorite Film</a></p><p><a href=#>Whatever Happened to Josh Hartnett?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaJ2eqbKzwMCipaadnql8c3yQcWZpb19ngnCmkK2co66VZLOzscCksGaeop6xosWMp6aw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
