It's been an ongoing snub fest between the "Famous" rapper and the "Lover" singer ever since — and with Taylor often on the losing end. Until recently, that is. Because #KanyeWestIsOverParty started trending after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unedited Taylor Swift/Kanye West phone call</a> leaked.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kanye reportedly called Taylor to get permission for lyrics in his song 'Famous.'</h2><p>In 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kanye released his song "Famous,"</a> which includes the lyrics: "For all my Southside [n-words] that know me best. I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/Why? I made that b---h famous."</p><p>Kanye insisted Taylor knew about about the name-calling ahead of time — and that she even gave him permission to degrade her like that. At the time, Kim also posted a video from Kanye's phone call with Taylor, which showed them discussing the "me and Taylor might still have sex" part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I mean go with whatever line you think is better. It’s obviously very tongue in cheek either way," Taylor can be heard telling Kanye. She also thanked him for giving her a heads-up. "I just had a responsibility to you as a friend," Kanye told her.</p><p>Later, Taylor was adamant that Kanye never got her permission to call her a "b---h" during that call. But because of the video "evidence" for the sex part, the overwhelming consensus was that Taylor was lying.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Even after sharing her side of the story, Taylor was on the receiving end of an overwhelming wave of hate — during which was was relentless called a liar and a snake. As Taylor revealed on her <a href=#>Netflix documentary Miss Americana</a>, this prompted her to basically drop off the gird for a whole year.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Leaked video from Kanye West and Taylor Swift's call video shows she was telling the truth.</h2><p>On March 20, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another portion of the conversation</a> between Kanye and Taylor during that infamous phone call leaked online. And during it, there was zero mention of Kanye calling her the b-word. It turns out, Taylor was telling the truth all along.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The leaked video shows Kanye telling Taylor the line will be, "To all my Southside [n-words] that know me best. I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex." Taylor laughs before replying, "That’s not mean!"</p><p>Kayne went on to explain, "If you felt it’s funny and cool and hip-hop and felt like just the college drop-out and Ye that you love, then people will be way into it."</p><p>To that, Taylor added, "I mean, I need to think about it … Because it is absolutely crazy."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Basically, the whole phone call leaked, revealing Taylor Swift never consented to being called “that bitch.”</p><p>She never lied or was a “snake.”</p><p>She was recorded illegally and manipulated by Kanye West and everyone owes her an apology.<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nTZXrJo7yS</a></p>— Ryan Schocket (@RyanSchocket) <a href=#>March 21, 2020</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Another part of the video showed West asking Swift how she would feel if he included a line saying, “I made her famous." It was pretty clear that although Taylor wasn't crazy about the idea, she understood that Kanye was simply sharing his perspective.</p><p>"Did you say that? Oh God, well, what am I going to do about it at this point. It’s just kind of, like, whatever at this point, but I mean, you gotta tell the story the way it happened to you and the way that you experienced it," she responded.</p><p>Taylor added, "You honestly didn’t know who I was before that. It doesn’t matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn’t know who I was before that and that’s fine. Yeah, I can’t wait to hear it.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nowhere in the latest clips does Kanye say anything about the "b---h" line — proving that Taylor wasn't lying and that Kanye is indeed the a-hole in this situation. One Twitter user summed it up perfectly, writing, "She was recorded illegally and manipulated by Kanye West and everyone owes her an apology." Amen.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">#CancelKanyeWestParty started trending on Twitter.</h2><p>For Swifties, justice has been served at long last — and they're not keeping quiet about it. They've taken to Twitter in droves, armed with a couple of hashtags: #TaylorToldTheTruth and #CancelKanyeWestParty. And it's glorious.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>My, how the tables have turned.

But I have a feeling a huge weight has been lifted off Taylor's shoulders— and that Kanye and his team are planning to lie low in damage-control mode for a while.</p><p>Hopefully, fans on both sides can take in all of the available information, acknowledge that Taylor wasn't lying this whole time, admit what Kanye did was pretty shady — and finally move on from it all. Just, you know, not before using the hashtag #KanyeWestIsCanceled.
