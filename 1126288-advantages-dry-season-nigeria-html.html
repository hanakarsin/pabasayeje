The drought period is a special aspect of the Nigerian climate. From a scientific point of view, the dry season is a result of North-East winds overtaking the northern part of Nigeria, and sometimes covering the entire territory of the country. Thus, the rainless season begins in the North, moves slightly to the East and then rolls down south.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7ca148d755fc8e64.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many seasons do we have in Nigeria?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The dry season is also famous for its high temperatures. Most years see the thermometers peaking at up to 43 degrees Celsius in June. Current trends show that the dry season is increasing in length. There’s also an interesting dynamic concerning the rainless periods. The 5-day dry spells are becoming rarer, while the drought periods of 10 or even more days are starting to be more common. Is such a change good or bad? Only time will tell. But one thing is certain - Northern Nigeria is becoming drier as the years go by.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/7ca148d755fc8e64.jpeg><p class=align-left>Logically, the dry season is associated with a number of challenges. Numerous wells and shallow rivers are left without even a trace of water. As a result, people and animals suffer from severe dehydration. Once upon a time, this problem was a true catastrophe, as civilization progresses, humanity found new ways to make water available. Hopefully, in the next few decades, Nigeria will find a way to get rid of this burden entirely.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt1ko0qljo3m5g.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where is the coldest place in Nigeria?</span></p></a><h2>Advantage of dry season</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1m2kf42re3m8.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> What is national development for Nigeria?</p><p class=align-left>The information provided in the previous paragraph may sound a bit depressing.

And during the “wet” part of the year, the choice is often to either get soaked outside or to be stuck at home.

The majority of Nigerians prefer to host festivals and celebrations in a wide open space.

According to various statistics, this approach is even more productive than the alternative. Farmers that dedicate their efforts to this farming in the dry season have a larger harvest while putting less work into their crops.</p><p class=align-left>Dry season farming usually includes planting vegetables and maize. It’s also worth mentioning that food collected during the season appears to be healthier and stays fresh for longer. The process of farming in the drought period is largely the same as in the rainy season, with one key difference – the farmer has to water the crops himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt2m99c6b9pvqg.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>Tip:</strong> It’s recommended to plant your vegetables along the riverside, as this is a more profound and less expensive solution than to pump all of the water yourself. Another option is to plant the suitable crops into pots. This way you can also save a lot of water and time.</p><p class=align-left>Now you know all of the benefits of the dry season in Nigeria. Is this season perfect? No, it’s not. But it does give us a lot of things to be thankful for.
