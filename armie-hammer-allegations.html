This was amazing," Courtney Vucekovich says in the trailer. "But then things changed." Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, Courtney says she dated Armie Hammer from June to August 2020.</p><p>"He pushes your boundaries a little bit at a time. You're his completely," she continues in the trailer. "He just acted mad." At one point, she says she received a note from Armie that said, "I'm going to bite the f--k out of you."</p><p>She details an experience where she says she was bound and "completely immobilized." It isn't long before tears run down her face as she recalls the incident with Armie Hammer, who allegedly has sadistic sexual fantasies involving complete control and cannibalism.</p><p>"The three-part docuseries takes a deep look at the allegations of emotional abuse, manipulation, and sexual violence that brought Hammer’s flourishing Hollywood career to a standstill in 2021, a saga previously examined by Vanity Fair’s Julie Miller in a story called '<a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fall of the House of Hammer</a>,'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> wrote.</p><p>Armie Hammer denies all allegations against him.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>In April 2021, Julia Morrison relayed that she would be selling her texts with Armie Hammer as NFTs. As for why she decided to do this, here's what she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on her website</a>: "These works speak to the medium and were cathartic and impactful for me to create. It allowed me to take my power back from someone much more powerful than me, someone who targeted me in an abuse of power, and to transform my feelings in a way that felt meaningful and with a clear sense of purpose."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a> published a 2021 article about another 24-year-old alleged victim who goes by the name Effie, claiming that Armie Hammer “violently” raped her for four hours on April 24, 2017.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"'I thought that he was going to kill me,' Effie said, but eventually, he left — 'with no concern for my well-being,' she added," The Cut article reads. She also commented on the incident at a 2021 <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">press conference</a> alongside women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred.</p><p>Regarding Armie Hammer's family history, he supposedly comes from a long line of abusive men. "If you believe about making deals with the devil, the Hammers are at the top of the totem pole," Casey Hammer, Armie's aunt, says in the trailer for House of Hammer.</p><p>The truth will come out on Friday, Sept. 2, 2022, on Discovery Plus.</p><p><strong>If you need support, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit </strong><a href=#><strong>RAINN.org</strong></a><strong> to chat online one-on-one with a support specialist at any time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2ButcRmn5qlnZq%2Fbq3LpZygmaSevK%2B%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
