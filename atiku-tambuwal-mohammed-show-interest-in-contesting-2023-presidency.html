Once the governors of PDP are able to move in one direction, align on most of the issues and the challenges we are faced with, I think there is hope for this country.</p><p>“The issue right now is that our party — PDP — has eminently qualified personalities that can lead this country successfully. Some have indicated interest like former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, like governor Tambuwal, like governor Bala Mohammed.</p><p>“They have indicated interest. But the bottom line is when we get to that bridge, we will definitely cross it. What is important at this stage, which I will solicit the support of PDP members and the generality of Nigerians, is please support us to have a successful national convention</p><p>“There is no way you can become anything — president, vice-president, even governor — if we don’t have a party. What we want to do first is ensure that we get things right within our party.”</p><p>On the readiness of the PDP to wrestle power from the APC in 2023, Makinde said: “Well, it is a question that I know Nigerians will answer and they will answer decisively.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FrZpqsmaDCbsDAppmur5Gheq67x5qkpp2UYsCpu9ZmoKeslaeytMCMoqVmm5%2Bjwaa%2F06KloGViZX90ec%2BrnKyhlJq7pMWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
