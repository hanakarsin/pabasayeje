Is it APC or PDP?.</p><p>“To pick ticket means you’re representing the interest of a party. I’m in PDP and I will not be involved in anti-party activities. If he is APC, I won’t support him because I’m not into that kind of politics.</p><p>“It is not about ethnicity for me, but about the party. If he joins APC I can’t support him.”</p><p>Meanwhile, APC has said it will welcome the former President should he consider joining the party.</p><p>National Secretary of the party, Senator&nbsp;John Akpanudoedehe&nbsp;said this while answering questions on a&nbsp;Channels Television&nbsp;Political Programme, Politics on Thursday.</p><p>Akpanudoedehe said like every other new entrant, Goodluck Jonathan if he eventually joined APC, would enjoy the rights and privileges extended to all members of the party.</p><p>According to him, the joining date of any new member won’t be a determinant for contesting any post.</p><p>Responding to a question on whether APC is truly wooing Jonathan to join the ruling party to become its Presidential standard-bearer for 2023, Akpanudoedehe said,&nbsp;“I don’t want to speculate.”</p><p>He added: “Everyone is allowed to join the APC, we welcome everyone who wants to join. We are getting stronger in terms of our progressive agenda. I’m hearing that for the first time, if he comes, we will welcome him, that will be great news.</p><p>“The last National Executive Committee meeting gave a blanket approval to everyone who wants to join the party and anyone who joins the party has the right to aspire for any office.”</p><p>Akpanudoedehe also said the party was expecting more governors from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party to join the APC before December, Naija News reports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BwZmtoYmh6qrKMo6anmaSdrq95yaigp6tdlr2kedOoZJynnqmytMCMn6arZaCnsrS1w56lrWWZYsSquMtmrqKjlWK%2FpsLEmqOsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
