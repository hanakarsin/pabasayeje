Soon, he was a regular on Mistresses and Atypical, then secured his spot in TV history with his role as the younger version of Emmy Award-winning Sterling K. Brown.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Niles finds his character very relatable.</h2><p>Talking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bello Mag</a>, Niles explained some of the ways playing teenage Randall has affected his life and career. "This role has impacted my professional and personal life," he said.</p><p>"Working with such great actors has improved my craft so much," Niles continued. "My personal life has changed because it's given me the ability to take care of and give back to my family after all their sacrifices."</p><p>Funnily enough, Niles started acting as a child so that he could save his own money for college. "I realized I wanted to act at 4 years old when I would audition for commercials and do print modeling jobs," he told the outlet.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>üèãüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>ü§†</a> (@nilesfitch) on Sep 12, 2019 at 6:04pm PDT</p></figure><p>"My parents saw that passion and thought getting me into the entertainment business would get me money for college," he added. "Fourteen years later, here I am!"</p><p>Niles also mentions that "everything that Randall has gone through, I've been going through," from learning to drive, prom, and entering college.</p><p>"Funny story," he interjected, "I had stopped studying for my learner's permit and then the script came, and Jack was teaching Teen Randall to drive! My mom freaked out because I needed my permit to film this part of the episode. We went to the DMV the next day ... I passed!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Follow Niles on Instagram to stay up to date with his upcoming projects.</h2><p>As expected, Niles' regular role on NBC's hit This Is Us is propelling the young actor's career into the spotlight.
