In fact, it was only midway through Season 1 when news was announced that Yellowjackets would indeed be returning for Season 2.</p><p>"Yellowjackets is a genre-bending, riveting story told across time periods, exploring the journeys of these women at two of the most formative times in their lives," said Showtime's President of Entertainment Jana Winograde in an official press release announcing the show's renewal. "We have an unbelievable cast, led by Juliette [Lewis], Christina [Ricci], Melanie [Lynskey], and Tawny [Cypress], in a series that’s going to leave you on the edge of your seat with every episode."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Showtime</span><p>A scene from 'Yellowjackets' Season 2</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When does 'Yellowjackets' Season 2 premiere?</h2><p>In a May 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, showrunners Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson confirmed that filming for Season 2 would take place during "late summer," but that the storylines tackled in Season 2 will be more winter-centric. As fans recall, the season finale ended with a gruesome flashback to winter 1996, where the girls were engaging in some rather bloody survival tactics.</p><p>Then in August, Lyle told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a> that the second season was "on a very similar production track in terms of time" as Season 1, adding that she believed they'd "finish shooting in about February and we’ll be airing sometime shortly after that."</p><p>Thankfully, this is still the case. On Dec. 7, 2022, the official Showtime Instagram account released a clip announcing the official premiere date. Mark your calendars because Yellowjackets Season 2 will be hitting our screens on March 24, 2023.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Yellowjackets on Showtime (@shoyellowjackets)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cast members hyped 'Yellowjackets' Season 2 during the 2022 Primetime Emmy Awards.</h2><p>While on the Primetime Emmy Awards red carpet on Sept. 12, 2022, Jasmin Savoy Brown (who plays the teen version of Taissa) noted that newcomer has impressed her co-stars as <a href=#>adult Lottie on the set of Season 2</a>.
