Shettima said the former Lagos governor supported President Buhari through thick and thin during the 2015 and 2019 elections and also supported other chieftains of the ruling party."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is fundamentally the reason I came out to endorse Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu.</p><p>“When he supported us he could have stood for the presidency, but he didn’t. He supported President Buhari through thick and thin, and one good turn always deserves another. There is a minimum threshold below which we should not operate as politicians; it should not be a case of anything goes. That minimal threshold requires that we should reciprocate in kind.”</p><p>Shettima stated that he is supporting Tinubu to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 based on the principle of payback and consistency.</p><p>He added: “My political association with Asiwaju Tinubu, which I am very proud of, is purely on the principle of payback and consistency. In the build-up to my 2015 re-election, soon after the APC was formed, I and those associated with me came under a serious political battle for the control of the party in Borno.</p><p>“At a point, Asiwaju invited all colliding parties to Lagos, right in front of my opponents, including one of them that was far closer to Asiwaju than me. Asiwaju supported me.</p><p>“He stood by us, and with his support; we were firmly in control of the APC in Borno State through the backing of the party’s national headquarters.</p><p>“Again, ahead of 2019, after the emergence of Professor Zulum as a candidate, Asiwaju resisted pressures from some quarters to have Zulum replaced.</p><p>“He openly raised the hands of Zulum, which he did not do for others. President Buhari did the same by honouring us and publicly endorsing Zulum amid litigation. These two endorsements significantly enabled us to consolidate our grip and match to victory at the polls. And you see, we needed to be consistent.</p><p>“Asiwaju played a key role in the formation and victory of the APC. For us in Borno, if we were to abandon, how would anyone trust us as northerners? In Borno, we stand by those who stand by us. This is our kind of politics and philosophy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze5BtZmtoYmh6uLTYZpmuoJGntm66zquroZ2io3qzscaipqdlo528trjDZqquqKCkv7V506KlrpqlYsCpsdOtoKaZXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
