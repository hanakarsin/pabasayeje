We will not dwell on this; we will push and fight to the end to make sure we qualify”, Alex Iwobi said.</p><p>“He already (the coach) said the travel was a lot for us. After the first game, we had to fly for four hours and another three hours. As players, we shouldn’t use that as an excuse and we have a lot of quality in the side. Like the coach said, the first half wasn’t good enough but the second was better so we have to look at that and see what we can do better to improve.</p><p>“It’s just the beginning, I’ll urge the Nigerian fans to stick by us because we will continue to fight”.</p><p>After the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Ivory Coast from January 13 to February 11, 2024, the Super Eagles will resume their 2026 World Cup qualifiers campaign against South Africa on June 24 in Nigeria.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FpZpqkla16qsPOm6BmmpWcwG66yKCcq6GRo8BurcWtnKtlpKy8brDRmq6sZZmjenN8kW9ksKeiobFur9SpZKqtkaG2p7XEq6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
