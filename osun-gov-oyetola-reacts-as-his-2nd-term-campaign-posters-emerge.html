Whatever the motives or intentions are, they are dead on arrival.</p><p>“For now, the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the State is more preoccupied with mobilising the people for membership registration and revalidation exercise, while Governor Oyetola is preoccupied with governance and not politicking.</p><p>“The Governor appreciates the goodwill and the solidarity of those behind it, if truly they are genuine, but wishes to state that what is uppermost in his mind at the moment is to take Osun to greater heights.</p><p>“He, therefore, appeals to those behind it to channel their efforts towards supporting government’s effort at changing the fortune of the State, which would probably make 2022 unattractive to the opposition.”</p><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<strong>Chief Mike Ozekhome</strong> (SAN) has <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>described as illegal and unconstitutional</a></strong> the arrest of #OccupyLekki protesters at the Lekki toll plaza including the detention of comedian Debo Adebayo aka Mr Macaroni.</p><p>Naija News reports that security agents had on Saturday assaulted and arrested peaceful #OccupyLekki protesters.</p><p>In a message sent to The Punch, the human rights lawyer stated that people were allowed to protest under the military regime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ze5BtZqirpaN6qLvVZqaynaSkuaJ50Z6YnKyjYq60eceiqmZqnpl6tbHRpmScmZ2lrqqzzWanqKukmr%2B0ecSmnKuflWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
