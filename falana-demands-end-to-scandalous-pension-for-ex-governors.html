Senators Daniel and Dankwambo have directed the Governments of Ogun and Gombe to stop paying them the pension since they are receiving salaries and allowances in the National Assembly.</p><p>“The Governments of Kwara, Imo and Zamfara States have abolished the payment of the pension. We call on other state Governments to abolish the pension as soon as possible. Nigeria can no longer afford to pay scandalous pension to ex-governors while workers are owed arrears of meagre pension. Therefore, the pension laws applicable to other public officers should also apply to all ex-governors.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5FqZp%2BZnJa7onnDnqSappSoeqa6w2arqGWjmK6vsMClpq6rXaWyr7%2FIqKVmnp%2BneqbEjKCmr52io7yzv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
