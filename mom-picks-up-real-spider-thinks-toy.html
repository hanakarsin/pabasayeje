Source: TikTok/@courttshortt31Whether you’re a mom of one, five, or even a #dogmama, every mother has likely experienced cleaning up after their kids. Once they brave their child’s messy room, many moms expect to see a few toys lying around. But one woman discovered there was more to her son’s bedroom than meets the eye."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Once they brave their child’s messy room, many moms expect to see a few toys lying around. But one woman discovered there was more to her son’s bedroom than meets the eye.</p><p><a href=#>TikTok</a> user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@courttshortt31</a> shared the incredible story of how she uncovered what she thought was one of her son’s toys. Here’s how she reacted when she discovered how live-action her child’s playthings could be.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@courttshortt31</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A mom was flabbergasted after picking up a real spider she thought was a toy.</h2><p>On May 24, 2023, Court posted a 29-second TikTok from what appeared to be her home. While rocking an old t-shirt and a hairpiece fit for a day of cleaning, she asked her fellow moms if their kids “have any toys that look like this?” The “this” Court was referring to was a dark green toy spider that looked all too real.</p><p>Although most childless adults aren’t used to seeing toy spiders scurrying around the house, Court said she’s become “used to it over the years.” So, when she started cleaning her son’s room, she didn’t flinch when she noticed another “toy” insect. However, Court soon realized she should’ve double-checked her surroundings, as she came across a real spider!</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@courttshortt31 href=#>@courttshortt31</a><p>No spiders (plastic or real) were harmed while making this video</p><a title="♬ original sound - courttshortt31" href=#>♬ original sound - courttshortt31</a></figure><p>In the video, she showed the actual spider trapped under one of her kitchen containers.</p><p>“I was just cleaning my son's room and picked up a little friend here,” the TikToker recalled. “Yes, I picked him up. Picked him up to throw him in a toy basket.”</p><p>Court told her followers how terrified she was to see the spider. She said she “never made a noise like that in my life” upon seeing the bug in her home. Thankfully, her idea of hiding the spider under a container seemed to work.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@courttshortt31</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Surprisingly, the mom’s TikTok commenters felt sorry for the spider.</h2><p>Following Court’s horrifying tale of picking up a spider she believed was a toy, several followers commented on the mishap. Many users applauded Court’s bravery and said they don’t know what they would do had they been in the same predicament.</p><p>“Mental note…. No spider or tarantula toys when my son gets older ✅,” one commenter stated.</p><p>“I would’ve immediately died,” another admitted.</p><p>It seems as though most users supported Court for how she handled the situation</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@courttshortt31</a></figure><p>Amid the virtual sympathy for Court, some commenters worried about how the real victim — the spider roaming free — likely reacted to the interruption.</p><p>“Spider: *Is lifted* "Well. This is an entirely unexpected turn of events,"’ one user mocked.</p><p>“He was just as scared as you were 😂” another reminded the TikToker.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@courttshortt31 href=#>@courttshortt31</a><p>Replying to @user115502256565 This is Kolston!
