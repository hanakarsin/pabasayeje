It’s a corset dress. But she didn’t make hers a corset dress."<p class=align-left>chef_mike_sauce:</p>"Not a completely bad recreation impressive just a few tweaking here and there.

She should've used mesh/net of her client's skin color for the cut out detail and waist area of the dress instead of nu.de crepe. The waistline area wasn't cinched compared to the style she got her inspiration from. I can't really identify the main fabric in the left side but I know it wasn't velvet sequins ( it made the dress looks kinda full/bulky ) aside those points I think she did a pretty great job though, the stoning detail on the bust area is really beautiful ❤️"<h2>Video of asoebi ladies in stylish looks sparks reactions</h2><p class=align-left>In a bid to slay at a wedding, three ladies <a href=#>went viral on social media</a> over their asoebi styles.</p><p class=align-left>In the video reposted by @asoebi_styles, the three ladies are seen looking eye-catching in their gold-coloured lace asoebi ensembles.</p><p class=align-left>With the styles featuring similar designs like dramatic front slits, plunging necklines and corset bodices, the ladies could pass for style twins.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiklZy2tXrNoGZqbGdtgHh8jKegoJ2inq6vecWaqqGhn6N6rbvVnqmsZaOdrrOxjK2fqK2XncG0ec6nZJ2do560r7HRrGSrnZOnsqLAyKilZq6VmrimsYyjmKado2LEsL7KZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
