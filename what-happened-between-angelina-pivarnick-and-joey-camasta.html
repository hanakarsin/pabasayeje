The series continued and the people on the show grew right along with it. When <a href=#>Jersey Shore: Family Vacation</a> premiered, the stars were totally different people. Marriages, babies, and jail sentences forced this cast to grow up over the years. They've all grown up.</p><p>Well, for the most part, they've all grown up. They're all still very much themselves, especially <a href=#>Angelina Pivarnick</a>. Angelina was a chaotic force to be reckoned with in the series, and that is something that has not changed. There have been more instances of "The Girls vs. Angelina" than there have been of peace between them. Angelina's volatile personality has gotten her into some trouble over the years, and now, <a href=#>Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi</a> has spilled some new tea about her Jersey Shore co-star.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @joeycamasta</span><p>Joey Camasta and Snooki</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What exactly happened between Angelina Pivarnick and Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi's friend Joey Camasta?</h2><p>Nicole has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a podcast</a> with her stylist and longtime friend, Joey Camasta, called It's Happening with Snooki and Joey. This particular episode was recorded in front of a live audience, and Angelina's name came up during the advice segment of their show. Nicole said, "I will say because the season is coming up that there is <a href=#>a feud</a> between Angelina and Joey. Angelina attacked Joey.” She went on to say that it was bad enough for the police to be brought in and that "prison sentences" would be involved.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @joeycamasta</span><p>Snooki and Joey Camasta</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joey Camasta is a podcast host, stylist, makeup artist, and a very close friend of Nicole Polizzi's.</h2><p>Joey and Nicole have known each other for a long time, but Joey also has plenty of his own projects going on. In addition to his stylist work and podcast with Nicole, Joey is also the co-host of another podcast called Out and About alongside Pat McAuliffe. Interestingly enough, Angelina was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">once a guest</a> on Out and About alongside <a href=#>RuPaul's Drag Race</a> All-Star <a href=#>Vanessa "Vanjie" Mateo</a>, where they drank and talked about <a href=#>All-Star Shore</a>. Things were friendly between Joey and Angelina, so what could have happened?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram @angelinamtv</span><p>Angelina Pivarnick</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Angelina has a legal battle ahead of her that she has to contend with, but luckily she has Teresa Giudice's family friend and lawyer, James Leonard, representing her.</h2><p>Nicole had a fairly joking tone in her voice when she mentioned the police being involved in the altercation between Angelina and Joey, likely meaning that she was over-exaggerating. But everyone is all too aware of the fact that <a href=#>Angelina was arrested</a> in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">June 2024</a> for "simple assault, criminal mischief, obstructing the administration of law and resisting arrest." She pled not guilty to the assault of the unnamed victim and is currently being represented by <a href=#>Teresa Giudice</a>'s friend and lawyer, James Leonard.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBnquwnZWjeqK6xp6joqaRYr2qwsCrpaKbm2Kur7CMo6aesV2Yrq6t0q2Y</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
