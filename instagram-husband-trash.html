Source: InstagramAny person who is in a relationship with a dude probably deals with them leaving their trash everywhere. Men live in a world that's been designed for them. What comes with that is the assumption that they can just leave their garbage everywhere and someone else will take care of it."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Men live in a world that's been designed for them. What comes with that is the assumption that they can just leave their garbage everywhere and someone else will take care of it. Well, one woman had quite enough of that type of behavior from her husband, so she started an Instagram account documenting all the trash he leaves around and all the weird things he does. It's called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@gomi_sutero</a>, which means "throw away your trash" in Japanese, and it's your new favorite thing. Guaranteed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Floor tissues</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>I've done that thing where I try to toss my tissue in the trash can like a basketball player. But when I miss, I walk up and put it in! Does this guy think that the garbage can and the floor around the garbage can are acceptable areas for garbage to be? Because he is sorely mistaken.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Empty bottles</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Why don't men understand that you finish one bottle before you start another? What is that?! Is it just impatience? Not paying attention to the world around them? This one would frustrate the heck out of me.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Squished chocolate</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>From the rough Google translation, it seems like this sad, squished chocolate candy somehow fell out of her husband's pocket and made its home on the floor. And he just...didn't notice. Didn't pick it up. Didn't save it from its smushed death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Juice box doorstop</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>"Is this supposed to be a doorstopper?" the caption says. This woman told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BuzzFeed</a> that she and her husband have been married for five years and have a daughter. So maybe this is their daughter's empty juice box. But still, dude, pick it up!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Trail of tissues</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Tissues aren't like breadcrumbs. You don't need to forge a trail of them in order to find the garbage can again. "Don't leave tissue paper like the acorns in My Neighbor Totoro," she wrote on this post. Too funny.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Toilet paper roll</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>The way couples handle replacing the toilet paper roll can be a source of much stress in a relationship. If you finish one roll and replace it, though, it's beyond lazy not to throw out the empty roll! Chances are there's a garbage can right next to the toilet!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Whole outfit</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Was he leaving his outfit on the floor to change into later? Did he purposely want to scare the bajeezus out of his wife, who definitely thought it was a dead body when she first walked into the room? What's the goal here, man?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Crumpled socks</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>One of the first of her husband's many messy habits this woman noticed is that he left his crumpled socks everywhere. This would drive me nuts! This is how you end up losing them and ending up with mismatched pairs and odd numbers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A lone contact lens</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Sure, contact lenses are small and sticky and hard to see. But if you're taking it out of your eye and it gets away from you, put your glasses on and take a look! Don't just leave it there until it gets all hard and brittle.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Glasses in the shower</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>Apparently, this dude showers with his glasses on and then just leaves his glasses in the bottom of the tub. But it's all good because his wife's caption completely nails him: "Does anybody take a bath with their glasses on and then leave it in the tub? If you know someone like that please let me know. You will be great friends with my husband."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnru0wMCgqZqlXZ3CtK7Ap5tmrKKWwKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
