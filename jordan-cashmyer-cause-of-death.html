In a statement on the family's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe page</a>, they spoke candidly about Jordan's struggle.</p><p>"Our daughter Jordan tragically lost her life on January 15, 2022, at the age of 26, leaving behind a sweet little 6-month-old girl. Addiction plagues many families, and our family was not immune to it," the page reads. "Jordan was always so full of life and full of personality. She had a way of always making those around her laugh and smile, and her smile was truly contagious. Our family is heartbroken, and we will forever miss Jordan."</p><p>The page went on to share that Jordan's baby daddy, Michael Frank Schaffer, also lost his life to drug addiction a mere four months before Jordan.</p><p>"Lyla lost her father to addiction at two months and now her mother at six months,” the post continued. “Our family has to now not only put our daughter to rest but navigate through starting over with an infant who has lost both her parents in her six months of life.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jordan Cashmyer (@jordancashmyer)</a></p></figure><p>This development follows the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!

Please understand and respect our privacy at this time. We are surrounded by the love and support of our children, granddaughter Lyla, and family members.”</p><p>“This is an incredibly sad day. Jordan was a sweet and caring person," her former publicist shared. "Last we spoke she was doing well and seemed to be in a good place mentally and physically. I wish people had the opportunity to know her beyond her struggles. I was always rooting for her and am grateful I had the chance to know and work with her all these years.
