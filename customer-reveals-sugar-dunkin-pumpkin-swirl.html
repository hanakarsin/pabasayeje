May we just apologize in advance that you may never order this delicious beverage again due to the appalling level of unhealthiness contained within."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Read on if you dare.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@flavcity</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Just how much sugar is in a Dunkin' Pumpkin Swirl drink? A lot.</h2><p>The creator, who is also known at The Grocery Store Guy, and who often dissects popular foods to better the health of followers, shared that there's a jaw-dropping 185 grams of sugar in this particular fall-inspired chilly beverage.</p><p>Since most of us aren't familiar with just how much 185 grams of sugar is, other than knowing it's a lot, the creator went on to note that this is equivalent to 46 teaspoons of sugar. Sweet Lord.</p><p>Put another way, this amount of sugar is equal to 14 glazed <a href=#>donuts</a>. As a bunch of commenters to this TikTok noted, we'd rather have the donuts!</p><p>But The Grocery Store Guy wasn't even done with his sugar overload overview.</p><p>He added that there's actually no pumpkin in this <a href=#>pumpkin treat</a>; it's just artificial flavoring.</p><p>Meanwhile, there are 12 mentions of sugar in the ingredients list, from high fructose corn sugar, to corn syrup.</p><p>If you're not already <a href=#>turned off from Dunkin'</a> drinks forever more, consider that as this popular creator told his audience, you'll imbibe 930 calories, and over 190 grams of carbs if you sip the sugary menu item.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Not everyone is going to skip this season Dunkin' drink, but others are completely grossed out.</h2><p>I can't lie; I would not order this drink after seeing this TikTok. But many commenters laughed off the creator's share, with one person simply saying, "So don't drink it. Calm down."</p><p>Fair enough.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@flavcity href=#>@flavcity</a><p>‚ùåüéÉDunkin‚Äô PumpkinüéÉ‚ùå <a title=dunkin href=#>#dunkin</a> <a title=dunkindonuts href=#>#dunkindonuts</a> <a title=americarunsondunkin href=#>#americarunsondunkin</a> <a title=eatthisnotthat href=#>#eatthisnotthat</a> <a title=addedsugar href=#>#addedsugar</a> <a title=pumpkinspiceseason href=#>#pumpkinspiceseason</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - FlavCity" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - FlavCity</a></figure><p>Others were impressed by his hutzpah of sharing this unflattering information about Dunkin' inside an actual restaurant.</p><p>Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, a large amount of commenters felt that the smart choice was basically to eat 14 donuts, and skip the not-really-pumpkin drink.</p><p>I'm loving this commenter's hilarious take on the sugary drink report: "With Dunkin', America won't be able to run anymore."</p><p>Someone else took the news more seriously and said a drink this unhealthy should be illegal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This creator also took on Starbucks drinks in case you're wondering.</h2><p>The creator who made no bones about sharing with the world that he is no fan of Dunkin' seasonal pumpkin drinks also wondered in another TikTok if the <a href=#>Starbucks</a> Pumpkin Spice Latte is a coffee drink or a dessert.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@flavcity href=#>@flavcity</a><p>üéÉStarbucks PSLüéÉ <a title=starbuckspsl href=#>#starbuckspsl</a> <a title=psl href=#>#psl</a> <a title=pumpkinspice href=#>#pumpkinspice</a> <a title=pumpkinspicelatte href=#>#pumpkinspicelatte</a> <a title=starbucks href=#>#starbucks</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - FlavCity" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - FlavCity</a></figure><p>Although not as unhealthy as its competitor's version, a <a href=#>Starbucks PSL</a> packs 50 grams of sugar, or more than 12 teaspoons of sugar. To be fair, he was reviewing a smaller drink than he did over at Dunkin'.</p><p>The bottom line is that this creator took all the fun out of pumpkin season. But he also does a good job of educating us about how truly sugary and unhealthy some of our favorite treats are. In moderation, it's probably all good, but to anyone who has a daily Dunkin' or Starbucks habit, perhaps stick to straight coffee.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmMK0wM6mnKtloprDpq3LrGSsrZeWv26w1KeioqZdpcKuvMqipWarp56%2FrQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
