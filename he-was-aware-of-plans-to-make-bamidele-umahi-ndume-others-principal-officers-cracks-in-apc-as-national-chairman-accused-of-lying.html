The governors and respected party leaders were involved in designing the power-sharing formula.</p><p>“After building consensus, the Senate President on Sunday led the new principal officers to Keffi for Adamu’s information and blessing.</p><p>“We still have the evidence of the photos taken on the farm. We do not know where Adamu was coming from in criticising the decision at the secretariat yesterday when he had the opportunity to raise objections with the leadership of the 10th National Assembly. He didn’t make any observations on Sunday.</p><p>“The slow process of notifying the National Assembly resulted in suspicion and tension. The APC National Secretary Sen. Iyiola Omisore on Monday signed the notice to the lawmakers but the letter couldn’t be forwarded because Adamu was yet to counter-sign.</p><p>“To prevent the opposition from presenting its list of officers ahead of APC, the Senate and the House leadership opted to act faster by unveiling the principal officers.</p><p>“Adamu believed the National Assembly ought to respect him and work at his pace.”</p><p>Sources also revealed that&nbsp;the presidency, APC governors and some party leaders participated actively in arriving at a “win-win” formula.</p><p>“The National Assembly has the backing of the Presidency and the Progressives Governors Forum on the harmonised list of principal officers.</p><p>“The APC caucuses in the National Assembly amicably agreed on the list of the principal officers and no one can stop it.</p><p>“Even when there were issues with Sen. Ali Ndume as the second-ranking Senator after Dr Ahmad Lawan, Senators prevailed on the Borno South Senator to accept to serve under Sen. Bamidele. Ndume bowed to pressure and accepted to be Senate Chief Whip.</p><p>“As the party’s national chairman, Adamu cannot overrule the decision of the APC caucuses in the Senate and the House of Representatives. There is no provision in the APC Constitution giving him such power,” another top source added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e49uZqGdXayutHnAsJirnV2ks268y5qlrGWkpHqurcqeZJuZnZ6xprjEZqymmZieeq%2Bw1KacZqeknbKzv4ypqaKmk569oriMqJ2foZOav7R5wquYnKOjYravecCpmmaZo2K7osDIqKWapF2YtaK10aaYp2WRmLC2v8SdZKieXaHGqrrGaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
