Here’s the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">In a TikTok video, a woman shared that public paper towels are disgusting to use.</h2><p>We can’t have nothing! In an Aug. 17, 2023, TikTok post, creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside Out (@geminigemini1982)</a> shocked users after revealing in a stitch post that paper towels in public settings are disgusting to use.</p><p>In response to creator Taco Reacts (@TacoReacts), who asked about company secrets that we shouldn’t know, Gemini left TikTok stunned with her answer.</p><p>“Paper towels at restaurants, department stores, and grocery stores, they are disgusting,” Gemini said. “And it’s so crazy because I see people snatching a piece of paper towel off and they use their foot because the door is so disgusting. You probably would have been touching the door with your bare hands and drying your hands on your clothes.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@geminigemini1982 href=#>@geminigemini1982</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @Taco reacts</p><a title="♬ original sound - Inside Out" href=#>♬ original sound - Inside Out</a></figure><p>Gemini then recalled her experience working in a warehouse with horrible conditions.</p><p>“I used to work in a warehouse that stored those paper towels,” Gemini said. “And it was just piles of paper towels. Oh baby, rats, roaches, spider eggs, everything.”</p><p>“And when we would get ready to pick them off and send them, we literally would just dust everything off,” Gemini said. “If they were stained, you would touch them with a little bit of water and that would take away the poop look or where spider eggs were or whatever."</p><p>She then shared that workers would “blow it off, give it a second, it would dry clean and then we’d ship it off.”</p><p>Gemini ended her video by saying there’s nothing wrong with touching the door, basically alluding to the door being cleaner than the actual paper towels provided in public settings.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@geminigemini1982</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">TikTok users are disgusted and even shared other instances of public cleaning practices being harmful.</h2><p>Nothing we learn on TikTok about the world we live in shocks most people anymore. So, when Gemini blew the whistle of dirty public paper towels, folks online were understandably outraged. In fact, it sounded the alarm of folks pointing out other everyday items we use that can be harmful to our health.</p><p>“Same thing for envelopes. Roaches like to eat the adhesive on the flap, so don’t lick them to seal them,” one person shared.</p><p>“I already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t use the air dryers</a>. Now I can’t use the paper towels?” another user asked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@geminigemini1982</a></figure><p>“This is why I always wash and dry my hands followed by hand sanitizer. Washing to get rid of external dirt, and sanitizer to get rid of germs,” another user revealed.</p><p>Based on the information shared in this TikTok video and by users in the comment section, it’s best to take proper action when you’re in public spaces.</p><p>Govern yourselves accordingly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpcKjuMicZKmZoJq%2FbsDOsJylZZGYwbaty6WwZpyZqLS2v9OipaA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
