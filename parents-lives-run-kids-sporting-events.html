Because, yeah, as parents, like this whole notion that we have to give up all of our time for our kids that is whack," Zito says.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @kito_delgado</span></figure><p>"It's literally meaningless. These games are pointless," Zito goes on to say, stating that many sports-obsessed parents are "underestimating" what they could be doing with their family during that same time.</p><p>Folks in the comments section seemed split down the middle on the subject, there was one user on the app who wrote: "I couldn’t imagine telling my kid no from doing something they love and want to do"</p><p>Someone else remarked: "Travel ball before 8th grade is a waste in my opinion. HS is at least where scouts may be at travel tourneys"</p><p>Another wrote that sometimes families are ruined by this avid dedication to their kids' sports careers: "Parents run themselves into bankruptcy and divorce bc they are funneling so much time and money and energy to sports. It’s insanity!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa6zsc2tqmakmauytHnRrqVmo5mZwG6%2Fz6ipraGenHqmwsSnq6w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
