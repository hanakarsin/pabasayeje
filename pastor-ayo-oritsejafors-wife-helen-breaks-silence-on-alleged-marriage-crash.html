It’s totally unbelievable, reprehensible and unthinkable and it’s important that I make the facts clear.</p><p>“I am a wife, a mother and a woman of God, and I uphold the tenets of my Christian faith and marriage. My family and home is the most important part of my life. I therefore appeal to everyone to put our interest and that of our lovely kids, above the need to profit from this baseless endeavor. My Husband and I are not divorced, unless people get divorced on social media and I have never been unfaithful to my husband, whom I love very dearly.</p><p>“These are works of the devil and his agents to dent my character and good works. Over the years, I have committed my time and resources towards reaching out to the needy, providing support to widows and giving scholarships to orphans. I have also taught and mentored a lot of young women on the principles of building and living happily with their spouses through my various platforms both on and offline. I cannot go against my own beliefs.</p><p>“Don’t forget that live is a seed. To carry a baseless news not supported is not only malicious but punishable under the law of the land.</p><p>“I plead with the general public to give my family the privacy it needs and disregard cheap attempts to dent my image.</p><p>“In retrospect to the fake news, I have briefed my lawyers and all necessary legal actions are being taken.<br>Thank you all and stay blessed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5BrZqmZo6m8s3nAsqZmp6KewbSxyZqdqKqjYsSqssRmn56klaN6o77EmqKsZaOeuaa6wp5kqKZdlrmtscaem2alkae%2Fqq3GnmScqpGotXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
