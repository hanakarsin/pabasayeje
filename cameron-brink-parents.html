And despite all the hard work sometimes it does. This is hard to fathom but I know it will only make me stronger. I will not be derailed and I will continue to love this life ‚Äî I'm not defined by basketball, but it's something that I love deeply and I will work everyday to get back to it."</p><p>Sadly, the ACL tear means that she will not be able to go to Paris as planned.
