Dressed in a black and white Chanel ensemble (that is definitely not from this season), the "Chanel Crasher" marches along as though she’s been doing it her whole life.</p><p>Gigi was finally the one to escort her off the stage, but not before the comedian drew massive internet attention. The model looked less-than-pleased about the whole fiasco, considering security probably should’ve gotten to her first. We don't think the two will become BFFs after this one.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Someone stormed the runway finale and joined the models <a href=#>@CHANEL</a> watch! <a href=#>#pfw</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Wp4L3yEccP</a></p>— @Booth (@Booth) <a href=#>October 1, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, who is "Chanel Crasher" Marie S’Infiltre?</h2><p>Marie, whose last name is actually Benoliele, is a comedian and YouTube personality who tries to “reveal the COMIC REALITY that is hidden in the news,” according to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a> channel, where she has over 200,000 subscribers. She’s best known for her satirical comedy, mostly making fun of the French bourgeoisie in her videos, and also runs her own one-woman show.</p><p>Her most viral video was from 2017, when she attended a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marine Le Pen rally.</a> She spends the video talking to supporters about their political views and seems to sympathize with the National Front party. Until the end, when she climbs onto the stage and gives the entire crowd two middle fingers before being escorted by security off stage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span><p>Marie on the Etam runway.</p></figure><p>Within the first 48 hours, the video racked up over four million views on Facebook, with many viewers finding her stunt hilarious against the far-right nationalist group. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzfeed News</a>, she said: "My approach has never been political, I want to show that all interests have a ridiculous comic potential."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This isn’t the first time she’s done this</h2><p>Just the previous week, Marie infiltrated an Etam show at Paris Fashion Week. After her infamous Chanel infiltration, she posted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: “Le défilé étam c'était walou à côté,” translating to “The Etam runway was nothing in comparison.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Marie's gotten herself into some hot water.</h2><p>While a lot of Marie’s videos are mocking the system, she also made a similarly controversial video at France’s Gay Pride in 2018. In the video, she dons a “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>La Manif Pour Tous</u></a>” flag, representing an anti-gay group in France. While Marie has frequently made other videos that are anti-homophobia, she drew a lot of controversy for this video.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Meanwhile, Gigi Hadid is still with Tyler Cameron.&nbsp;</h2><p>Gigi is still currently dating former Bachelorette finalist Tyler Cameron, even with her busy fashion week schedule. The pair have entered a very public relationship following Cameron's departure from The Bachelorette.&nbsp;</p><p>Their relationship follows Hadid's very public breakup with Zayn Malik and Tyler's relationship with Hannah Brown.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWiusSlZJyqkai1pr6MoKCgoV2drqW1ww%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
