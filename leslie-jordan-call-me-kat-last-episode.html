The episode aired days after Leslie’s death. After the Thanksgiving episode, the sitcom aired its fall finale, a Christmas special that didn’t mention Phil’s absence. However, Mayim later confirmed on her Instagram that a 2023 episode <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">would be a tribute to Leslie</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by mayim bialik (@missmayim)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How will 'Call Me Kat' handle Leslie Jordan's death?</h2><p>The episode Mayim was referring to is Call Me Kat’s winter premiere. Ahead of the Jan. 5, 2023 episode, “Call Me Philliam,” the star said she and the rest of the cast found a way to close Phil and Leslie’s chapters with “a way for him to live forever.”</p><p>“The cast felt very strongly and completely unanimously that the thought of doing a funeral episode while we are actively grieving our friend — it felt like a hurdle we weren’t sure we all wanted to jump together,” Mayim explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>. “I think Leslie Jordan was known so much for being Leslie, and while we also love him and know him as Phil, he’s such a beloved personality, truly larger than life."</p><p>“To try to encapsulate that felt challenging in ways that I don’t know would’ve been healthy for us as a cast or a production,” she continued. “So, we found a way for him to live forever. His character will live forever, and he can have whatever adventures we all imagine.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by mayim bialik (@missmayim)</a></p></figure><p>Mayim also said Leslie’s tribute episode includes a celebrity who Leslie said he “admired and considered a mentor of his.” Additionally, the episode introduces fans to Phil’s mother, played by his The Cool Kids co-star <a href=#>Vicki Lawrence</a>. But fans shouldn’t be worried about Vicki’s character being “the new Phil.” Mayim told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a> that Call Me Kat has no plans to replace her with her late co-star.</p><p>“We don’t want to try and replicate Phil because you can’t,” Mayim said of Vicki’s appearance. “Just like Leslie Jordan, there is no replicating that character or person. But we wanted someone who had enough of the feel-good aspects of Leslie’s character and enough of that sharpness and fun Leslie brought to his character.”</p><p>Before Vicki’s guest spot, Maria Ferrari, an executive producer for the Fox series, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Deadline</strong></a>, "Leslie’s death absolutely affected the storylines." However, she said she was hopeful that adding Vicki would bring back some of Leslie’s comedic spark.</p><p>"She’s amazing and so funny,” Maria said of Vicki. “We mentioned it, and God bless her; she didn’t hesitate; she said yes right away. We know the spirit of Phil will certainly be with her. It’s going to be fun to have that character doing some of the same in-jokes we did when Phil was there.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Fox</span><p>Vicki Lawrence, guest star Jay Linzy, Cheyenne Jackson, Mayim Bialik, Kyla Pratt, Julian Gant and Swoosie Kurtz on 'Call Me Kat' Season 5.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Call Me Kat’s' cast and Fox mourned Leslie Jordan following the news of his death.</h2><p>When news broke of Leslie's fatal car crash, his co-stars and Call Me Kat's network honored him on the show and online. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox's tribute to Leslie</a> featured snippets of the actor on LEGO Masters, The Cool Kids, Fantasy Island, and The Masked Singer.
