Jake has taken over as the starting quarterback following <a href=#>Joe Burrow</a>'s injury in Week 11.</p><p>“He just lit the world on fire,” Bengals head coach Zac Taylor told reporters following the game, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Around the NFL</a>. “I just thought he managed the game beautifully well. He was aggressive with some of his throws, did a great job making plays with his feet … Just really proud of Jake and the job he did.”</p><p>And Jake had the support of his girlfriend at Monday’s game, as fans can see on Instagram.

Five years, four different time zones, and 14 different moves later, here we are. Whether it’s a fancy dinner party or a dive bar in Folsom, you move through life with a contagious energy, and I can’t imagine where’d I’d be without my mob wife. Love you, pimp.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stephanie co-founded a sustainable swimwear label.</h2><p>In recent years, Stephanie has devoted social media posts to a company called 7th Street Swim, a clothing brand “where downtown cool meets uptown quality,” as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its Instagram profile</a> touts.
