Source: Twitter/@HillsongFor some Christians, Hillsong Church was a name they knew and trusted for years. But that changed after Hillsong came under fire in November 2020 thanks to its New York City church pastor Carl Lentz getting fired for &#34;moral failures,&#34; according to Hillsong founder Brian Houston, who released a statement shortly after."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It may still be a beacon of light to some of those who follow the Christian faith, but to many others, it is seen as a church overwrought with greed and contradictions. In 2020, Carl was fired from his position as pastor after his infidelity in his marriage came to light.</p><p>However, that's not the only reason Hillsong is shrouded in shame. Discovery Plus's March 2022 docuseries <a href=#>Hillsong: A Megachurch Exposed</a> profiled "numerous ex-members of the church who have come forward to share harrowing allegations of the trauma, abuse, and financial and labor exploitation that created a culture of chaos within the church."</p><p>In January 2022, founder Brian Houston officially resigned from his positions within the church amid ongoing allegations that he tried to cover alleged child sexual abuse at the hands of his late father. Although he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pled not guilty</a> to covering it up (and is awaiting trial), Houston stepped down from his positions of power within Hillsong at a time when the church's name continued to be tarnished.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Hillsong Church employees Ben Houston, Bobbi Houston, Laura Lentz, and Carl Lentz.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Hillsong Church still open?</h2><p>Despite the ongoing issues within the church, Hillsong is still open. There are various Hillsong locations around the world including California New York City, Boston, and New Jersey. You can use the "find a church" feature on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hillsong website</a> to find a location near you.</p><p>Or, if there isn't one, the church is active online to provide remote sermons to everyone who isn't able to attend in-person services. Despite allegations against multiple members of the church, it continues to operate.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is in 'Hillsong: A Megachurch Exposed'?</h2><p>The Discovery Plus docuseries about Hillsong features interviews with <a href=#>Ranin Karim</a>, the woman who had an affair with Carl, and Jaclyn Hayes and Janice Lagata, who both worked under Carl and can attest to the cult-like mentality they experienced with him as a pastor.</p><p>Executive producer Dan Johnstone told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> in March 2022 that he discovered Hillsong Church to be "a cultural phenomenon" that "crossed over from religious culture into pop culture." He also explained that he wanted to tell the story of the church itself and the impact it left on those within it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>We tested out one of our new @hillsongnyc “house party” ideas and it went well!!
