According to the former Minister of Works, the governors are ready to work for the actualisation of Tinubu’s presidential bid.
He explained the governors are supporting Tinubu because of his administrative acumen, mental capacity, rare leadership quality and unequalled political structures which cut across the six geo-political zones."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I am happy that the new executives have passion for this group and this will lead to action and eventually victory for all of us.</p><p>“APC leaders and members across board are using their personal money to fund SWAGA. Members are not after money. Let me tell you this, 16 governors are now backing Tinubu for president and they are no longer afraid after Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State openly supported us when we did the flag off in Lagos.”</p><p>Speaking on the congress held in the state on Saturday, Adeyeye said the APC ward and local executives elected at the party’s congresses were authentic.</p><p>He, however, described the executives elected by a group loyal to Governor Kayode Fayemi on Saturday as mere impostors.</p><p>He said: “Those that were inaugurated today are the authentic APC executives in Ekiti. The party at the national level brought out a guideline that people should come out and queue to vote for the ward and local government congresses but their people didn’t come out. They were inside a room concocting names under the guise of consensus.</p><p>“But SWAGA members filed out. We have the video clip that we will present. What they did on Saturday, October 16 was a nullity and a complete waste of time.</p><p>“We knew what we did for Fayemi to win in 2018. He couldn’t have won on his own because he has no popularity.</p><p>“I know that they can’t buy you with money, you are for SWAGA. This government has finished, don’t let them deceive you with positions.</p><p>“Only the Fayemi’s Tokantokan group is enjoying the dividends of what we did, others are sidelined. It is now shopping alone, die alone.</p><p>“Even many of those with appointments are aggrieved. Many will shock them during the governorship primary. We are now using direct primary. They can no longer sleep because the party now wants direct primary, owing to the fact that they are not popular.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5FqZmpuXZa9pHnGqK2epp%2BnwG6%2F1KmnqKqkYsGqutSbrKxlYmV%2FdHnPq5ysoZSau6TFjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
