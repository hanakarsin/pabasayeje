Firefighting isn’t for the faint of heart and in “A Cry for Help,” Gabriela shares her fears that she may never complete her probationary training.</p><p>“I need to throw a ladder unassisted, it's one of the skills I have to master to graduate from being a probie,” she explains to Bode in a sneak peek, adding that she has a long way to go before she’s ready to join the squad. “Look at all these blank boxes.”</p><p>But Gabriela’s doubts are met with words of encouragement. “Look at all the completed ones,” Bode adds.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>She admits that she received the same advice from his father, who previously told her that her training could take up to two years. “Your dad said I should have patience and that it usually takes probies two years to check off all the boxes,” she says. “I told him that patience wasn't what got me into the Olympics, it was practicing until my lungs got bruised.”</p><p>In the direction she’s headed, Gabriela may be trying to push the process a little too fast. Will she burn out before completing her training?</p><p>Aside from Gabriela internally struggling with the probationary process, the episode will also see the Cal Fire team pitted against one another.</p><p>"An internal investigator suspects Jake of being the serial arsonist setting recent fires, so Bode and the crew take it upon themselves to investigate," the episode bio reads.</p><p>Find out what happens next on new episodes of Fire Country airing at 9 p.m. EST on CBS and available to stream live on Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ygmJuqmZq5onnBnpqopZVirm6yyKucn6GXncGmvoyipWaemaeybq%2FOrqWtqqk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
