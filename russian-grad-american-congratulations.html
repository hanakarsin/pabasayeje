You rock!" The simple gestures seemingly touched the new college grad, who was beaming and practically on the verge of tears.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@realrussianclub href=#>@realrussianclub</a><p>American strangers made my day todayüòçüòçüòç <a title=lifeinusa href=#>#lifeinusa</a> <a title=americans href=#>#americans</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - realrussianclub" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - realrussianclub</a></figure><p>"It's just so priceless," she added. "Before coming to the United States, I always heard how Americans are so fake and all the smiles are fake. But I don't know, it's so real to me; it's just so unbelievable." The new graduate also took to the comments section and revealed that people were hanging out of car windows to wave, smile, and honk at her.</p><p>"Kids were yelling, 'Congratulations!'" she wrote alongside a teary-eyed emoji.</p><p>The video instantly racked up thousands of comments, with fellow TikTokers sharing their thoughts on the touching situation. One user commented, "It's real to them too! We love to celebrate people even if we don't have a personal investment in them. Also, CONGRATS!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @halcyon986</span></figure><p>"We're not perfect, but we love achievers, and we love to show our love to others. Congratulations," another wrote. A third TikToker replied, "You got a true taste of American enthusiasm! We were congratulating everyone at my son's graduation all day! A huge accomplishment!"</p><p>A fourth explained that although most of their smiles are small and awkward, they would offer the OP a genuine grin if they saw her walking around in her cap and gown. Honestly, we would too!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikToker / @caliexpat</span></figure><p>Others took the time to share similar experiences: "My best friend from Italy said she never got a compliment till she came to America, and she can't believe how nice Americans are," a TikToker penned.</p><p>"When my adopted daughter goes back to her country to visit, people look at her crazy bc she forgets & chats happily w/ them like in the U.S. It's real," a second user noted. Another revealed that their cousins from other countries think they're because they'll "talk to any stranger," adding, "It's normal in America to talk to strangers."</p><p>Well, we couldn't be happier to hear that OP had a wonderful graduation day!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp8K0v8iapWafopaxbq3Mnqmim5GjeqS7zaCpmqyloa61tc6nqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
