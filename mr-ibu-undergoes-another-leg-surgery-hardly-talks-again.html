I’m calling on all fans and well-wishers of the actor to join hands with other philanthropic Nigerians to support him in this dire time.”</p><p>He revealed that he has approved the sum of N250,000 to be sent to the ailing actor’s account from the AGN Trust Fund, which, according to him, may not be enough, following Muonagor’s records with the Guild HMO and Insurance policy.</p><p>Recall that weeks back, Amaechi Monagor’s cousin, Tony shared the actor’s health update on Facebook, when he revealed he was battling for his life after he was diagnosed with kidney disease, diabetes, and stroke during his three-week hospital admission.</p><p>Tony in his post wrote, “This picture was taken two weeks ago when I visited my cousin Amaechi Monagor (Aguiyi) at the Nnewi Teaching Hospital. I initially had wanted to quietly assist as much as I could but later decided to make this post to clarify some things so that my friends, fans, and Amaechi’s fans, and indeed the online community can be better informed.</p><p>“Amaechi is currently down with kidney disease, diabetes, and stroke. He had been managing his diabetes over the years and living his life. He is at present undergoing weekly dialysis and other treatments at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University Teaching Hospital Nnewi.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BvZqaqXZ6vtnnUp5ueqpeksrR5wKemraCVp3qtscZmqq6ql5q%2FunnHmqmdpKliwaK4yqxkmp%2BRnrtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
