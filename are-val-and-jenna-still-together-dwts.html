Source: Getty ImagesOver 28 seasons, Dancing With the Stars has produced more than a few showmances, but the ABC competition series is also to thank for several real-life romances, including the one between pro dancers Valentin &#34;Val&#34; Chmerkovskiy and Jenna Johnson.
The pair began an on-again, off-again relationship in 2015, one year after Jenna joined the show as a troupe member."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But are the performers currently an item?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are Val and Jenna from DWTS still together?</h2><p>We’re happy to report that Val and Jenna are not only still a couple four years after they first got together, but they’re also newlyweds! The duo tied the knot on April 13, 2019 at a resort in Rancho Palo Verdes, Calif.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The bride looked stunning in a long-sleeved <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vera Wang gown</a> topped with a custom crystal headpiece, which was on full display during the pair’s (unrehearsed) first dance.&nbsp;</p><p>"All I wanted to do was slow dance with my husband," Jenna told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> of the couple’s decision to nix a choreographed routine. "I’m sure many people expected a produced dance, but we wanted to keep it genuine and real."</p><p>The 200-guest wedding took place 10 months after Val popped the question in Italy with a rectangular cushion-cut diamond ring. "When I was 17, I visited Venice for the first time and thought it was the most romantic place in the world," the 33-year-old recalled to People shortly after the engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>"I promised myself then that the next time I would come back to Venice was to propose to the woman I’d want to spend the rest of my life with. Fifteen years later I kept my word. It was perfect."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Talking about his future wife, Val gushed, "My life has changed because of [Jenna], and I find myself to be the best version of myself that I’ve ever been. She’s awesome."</p><p>Six months later, the honeymoon phase appears to be going strong. During a recent trip to Disneyland with the DWTS Season 28 cast, Val proudly captioned <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a photo</a> of the duo: "f a princess, I got me a queen."

"I think Jenna’s going to be an incredible mom," he previously shared. "She’s already an amazing companion and I love her very much for many reasons."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The brunette beauty, 25, added, "We’re literally both the same person, just male and female, so I can’t wait to see how intense and competitive and passionate about life our kids are too."</p><p>In an August interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a>, Jenna confirmed that the duo is focused on each other and work for the time being. "We want kids. Not right now. We want to enjoy being married," she said.</p><p>Plus, the couple is currently content in their roles as aunt and uncle to nephew Shai, the son of Val’s older brother Maksim and his wife Peta Murgatroyd, who also met through DWTS.
