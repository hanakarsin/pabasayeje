If we don’t come together to challenge what the ruling party is trying to create, our democracy will suffer for it, and the consequences of it will affect the generations yet unborn.”</p><p>Speaking during an interview with The Punch, Abdullahi, the PDP Deputy Publicity Secretary, said Atiku made the call to protect the future of Nigeria.</p><p>Abdullahi insisted that only a coalition of political parties would successfully push out President Bola Tinubu-led APC administration from power.</p><p>He said, “We believe only merger or coming together of all opposition political parties will produce a better result. So there is a need for other political parties to understand that it will be difficult to defeat the All Progressives Congress without a merger.</p><p>“So the other political parties must see the reason and identify with the PDP’s clamour for coalition. So, if they see this, then the better for Nigeria’s opposition and the people.</p><p>“But if other political parties want to go about it individually, they are not as strong as the PDP. It is very difficult for us to attain the objective of taking charge of the government and sacking this army of occupation that has decided to inflict maximum penury and anguish on Nigerians.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5BsZqKsXay2rbiMm5xmnJmbs6qv1KWrZqyfYsSzsdKto55loKTEpr6Mn6mopV2WvaR5yKdka2hibHqxsM9mmqGhlZvBorXNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
