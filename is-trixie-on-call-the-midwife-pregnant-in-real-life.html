“They don’t seem to be hiding the fact that Helen George was pregnant whilst filming as well as they did the first time,” one viewer tweeted on Jan."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(Also, thank you for the lovely comments!)” she wrote. “Women get pregnant, our bodies change. But we have the right to work if we choose to do so. How about just supporting it, and don’t question it?”</p><p>According to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">screenshot</a>, a now-suspended <a href=#>Twitter</a> user named Fanny was one of those naysayers. “It’s very unprofessional, in my opinion,” Fanny <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a> on Jan. 30. “It’s a short window. She should quit if she wants to be pregnant during filming. It ruins continuity and the aesthetics of the show.”</p><p>The screenshot also reveals that Olly Rix, the actor who plays Trixie’s love interest Matthew Aylward on the show, rose to Helen’s defense and responded to that user, writing, “Take a bow, Fanny. Dumbest f—king tweet of the night.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’ve seen too many ridiculous comments about my pregnancy whilst filming <a href=#>@CallTheMidwife1</a> ( also thank you for the lovely comments!)

And that was the last fans saw of the character, leading some to suspect Helen George and Trixie had exited the show.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Express</a>, however, speculates that Helen’s leave from the period drama is not permanent and that she’s likely to return for the 12th series. As the tabloid reports, Helen gave birth to Lark, her second child, in November 2021, the same month that filming on Call the Midwife’s 11th series wrapped.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Helen George (@helenrgeorge)</a></p></figure><p>The actress and her husband, Jack Ashton, who played Rev.
