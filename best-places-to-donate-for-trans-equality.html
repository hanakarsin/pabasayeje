When the trans community and their allies observe <a href=#>Transgender Day of Remembrance</a> every year on November 20, we honor trans people whose lives were lost throughout the year to hate crimes and trans erasure. Forbes recently reported that this year, more than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">375 trans folks were murdered</a> in what is currently the "deadliest year" for the community.</p><p>Meanwhile, trans people are still being targeted by hate speech and ignorance from <a href=#>popular comedians with enormous platforms</a>. Being trans deserves to be celebrated, but as the world continues to silence the voices of trans and gender non-conforming folks, the fight for equal rights rages on. If you are in a position to offer financial assistance to the transgender community, consider donating to one of these organizations.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Transgender Law Center</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Transgender Law Center/YouTube</span></figure><p>According to their official site, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Transgender Law Center</a> is the largest national trans-led organization in the country.
