Source: Getty ImagesLongtime Swifties have waited a decade for the full, 10-minute version of the cult favorite song &#34;All Too Well,&#34; and with the release of &#34;Red (Taylor's Version),&#34; Taylor Swift's fans can finally hear all of the lyrics that were originally cut from the massive breakup track.
While Taylor has said in the past that she never expected the song to gain such notoriety among her fanbase, listeners connected many of the lyrics in the track to her whirlwind romance with actor Jake Gyllenhaal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Swiftie sleuths pieced together that this was likely the scarf Taylor wore on her outing with Jake and his sister Maggie Gyllenhaal ‚Äî and it didn't take long for them to find photos of him wearing what appears to be the same scarf out years later.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚Äúi left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer, even now..‚Äù</p><p>10 years ago, Taylor Swift lost her scarf after going out with jake & his sister Maggie Gyllenhaal in NYC. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/l9VkmwuXb1</a></p>‚Äî popreset (@popreset_) <a href=#>November 11, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Maggie even joked about the possibility of Taylor leaving it at her house on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch What Happens Live in 2017</a>.</p><p>"You know I never understood why everybody asked me about this scarf," Maggie said at the time. "What is this? I am in the dark about the scarf. It's totally possible [Taylor left it], I don't know."</p><p>But regardless, Maggie claims she never saw it ‚Äî is it possible Jake still has it? According to a few people, he might not anymore.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>this is gonna sound crazy and you will definitely think i‚Äôm kidding but i‚Äôm not - i think i am in possession of that scarf.</p>‚Äî andrew burnap (@McDrewBur) <a href=#>November 12, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who has Taylor Swift's scarf?</h2><p>There are a few people who have claimed to have the scarf since "Red (Taylor's Version)" dropped.

The creator behind the account claimed in her Instagram stories that she's seen the proof this follower has the scarf and is trying to find a way to return it to Taylor after all of these years.</p><p>It seems it's entirely possible that, even now, Jake does not still have it in his drawer.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@elizabethgerardimusic href=#>@elizabethgerardimusic</a><p>prob gonna end up deleting this üòÖthere‚Äôs other lyrics i wanted to include didn‚Äôt have enough time! <a title=swiftie href=#>#swiftie</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ All Too Well - Instrumental With Background Vocals - Taylor Swift" href=#>‚ô¨ All Too Well - Instrumental With Background Vocals - Taylor Swift</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is the scarf a metaphor?</h2><p>While many are very certain that the scarf is a real, tangible accessory that Taylor left at Maggie's house before being swiped and held ransom by Jake, some other Swifties have hypothesized that there isn't actually a scarf ‚Äî instead believing that the scarf is another metaphor.</p><p>Taylor's lyrics are riddled with metaphors, so this theory is entirely possible. Some fans believe that the "scarf" Taylor left behind was actually her virginity.</p><p>The hit singer is pretty mum about the details of her love life beyond what she shares cryptically in her music, so of course, there is no way to confirm this, but it's entirely possible there was never a scarf left behind to begin with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWweceaqmaska65sL6MrK6inqSoerSvwKud</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
