It includes three main elements: community participation, organization, and work.</p><p class=align-left>After the WWII, British officers were concerned with so-called community development, a new idea at that moment. The administrators promoted a new concept to develop “basic education” and social wealth in the British colonies. They emphasised on literacy training and promotion of agriculture, health service by the means of local self-help. The British colonizers were concerned with the poor rural development in North America in the first decades of the 20th century.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5a15fee9fab3060b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 5 characteristics of developing countries</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Community development was defined in one British government publication as follows:</p>“active participation, and if possible on the initiative of the community, but if this initiative is not forthcoming spontaneously, by the use of techniques for arousing and stimulating it in order to achieve its active and enthusiastic response to the movement”.<p class=align-left>The idea of community development was implemented, partly, as a response to the growth of nationalism in the colonies, and, partly, as a desire to improve industrial and economic development. The idea began to appear often in US documents in the middle of the 20th century. The idea incorporated three important elements:</p><li>a desire to increase the level of social and economic development;</li><li>the increase of local co-operation and self-help;</li><li>the use of expertise from other local communities.</li><p class=align-left>However, there seems to be quite an important contradiction. Community development includes participation, initiative, and self-help by local communities as well as sponsorship by national governments. From one side community development involves the encouragement of local decision making, from the other it implies implementation of the governmental policies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4dkm2u6hl17.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 main factors of population growth in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Community development has made a great influence on British literature.

In Scotland, there occurred a shift from community education to community learning and development. There took place numerous debates around the idea of community development. The way it was being approached has changed to some extent. One of the significant aspects was concerned with informal education.</p><p class=align-left>The most remarkable contributions have been made by Alison Gilchrist and Marilyn Taylor. They claimed social justice to be one of the key elements of community activity. They argued that the</p>“focus is on individuals, groups and networks that want or need to cooperate in order to achieve change at a local or community level. Adopting a community development approach means ensuring that the issues and priorities are identified and agreed by the communities themselves, and that people are encouraged to work together towards a collective solution to a shared concern”.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7ol9nc6jugp.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The importance of social studies in primary school</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Gilchrist and Taylor suggested that there were the following crucial aspects of community development:</p><ul><li><strong>Informal education.</strong> It involves learning through direct involvement in community life.</li><li><strong>Collective action. </strong>It consists in uniting the efforts, strengths, and determination; many people should act for their mutual benefit or to protect the interests of the community members who are not able to stand up for themselves.</li><li><strong>Organization development.</strong> This aspect is aimed at helping groups and communities in evolving a form of activity that enables the members to achieve their goals.</li></ul><p class=align-left>The new vision of community development helps to connect three areas of practice in the service of community development the way that is more suitable to the needs of the present day society.</p><h2>Types of community development projects</h2><p class=align-left>Community development projects are aimed at strengthening local communities.
