The two-part <a href=# style=text-align:start>Netflix</a> series shows how Manti rose to fame as a <a href=# style=text-align:start>Notre Dame football player</a>, battling through grief after the death of his online girlfriend, Lennay. But the doc also shows how Lennay turned out to be a fake persona assumed by one Ronaiah Tuiasosopo. So, where is <a href=# style=text-align:start>Ronaiah Tuiasosopo</a> now?</p><p style=text-align:start>For starters, Ronaiah is a transgender woman who transitioned after the <a href=#>catfishing</a> scandal and now uses the nickname Naya and she/her pronouns — but she also goes by Ronaiah, as a Netflix representative confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bustle</a>. So, what is Ronaiah up to these days? Let's explore!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Naya says her relationship with Manti was “completely selfish” but she was “in love with being looked at in this way.”</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span><p>Manti Te’o</p></figure><p style=text-align:start>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>, Manti asked Untold directors Ryan Duffy and Tony Vainuku to interview Naya for the documentary to get both sides of the story.</p><p style=text-align:start>And as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> recaps, Naya says in the documentary that she was working through confusion around her gender identity while she was chatting with Manti. “The Lennay profile was not necessarily a way out but a way to something else,” she explains. “At that time, I knew for sure there was something inside of me that just wanted to scream out and be like, ‘Why am I different?’”</p><p>She goes on: “There were a couple of encounters online where it was like, ‘This guy’s cute. Let’s see where this goes.’ I knew what was right and wrong, but I was too far in love with being looked at in this way. It was completely selfish, but it was what made me happy. It was what I wanted to be a reality.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ronaiah Tuiasosopo now lives a low-profile life in Seattle.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by NAYA (@nayatui)</a></p></figure><p style=text-align:start>According to The Guardian, Naya moved back to American Samoa after the scandal and found community in the territory’s LGBTQ+ population, including those who are of the fa’afafine third-gender identity.</p><p style=text-align:start>“I just had to start living my life,” she says in the documentary. “And I wanted to be able to live my life as trans. I still feel horrible [about the hoax], and sometimes I wish that everything had been undone. But then also another part of me was like, I learned so much about who I am today and who I want to become because of the lessons I learned through the life of Lennay.”</p><p>According to Bustle, Naya is now back in the States, living and working in Seattle, Wash., and maintaining a low profile. At the beginning of 2023, Naya shared images of her work life at Lowe's, though it isn't cleared if she's still employed there.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Manti Te'o (@mantiteo)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to Manti Te’o?</h2><p>As for Manti, the <a href=# style=text-align:start>NFL</a> player says he hasn’t been in contact with Naya but has long since forgiven her. “For the first three years, my life was extremely difficult, and I was desperate to find peace,” he says in the doc, per USA Today. “The only thing that I could think of during that time was forgiveness, was to let it go.
