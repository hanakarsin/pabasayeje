Please do not believe them and do not give them money,” Adeboye said.</p><p>“Somebody even went to the ridiculous extent of saying that I needed money to go to India for the treatment of an undisclosed ailment. Please do not answer them. As you can see I am not sick. I am hail and hearty. They are liars.”</p><p>Continuing, he said some others are equally impersonating his wife, pointing out that such persons are not representing him or his wife. According to him, some other fellows are busy sending e-mails to people inviting them to fake programmes purportedly organised by the General Overseer.</p><p>“If anybody invites you to any programme anywhere in my name, please confirm from me. There is also one that said I had a dream where I saw many of my people weeping because they could not make it to heaven. It is all lie! I did not have any dream and I know that you will all make it to heaven in Jesus name,” he stated.</p><p>On recent stories by some persons who claimed they died and got to heaven but were sent back to warn brethren who are perceived to be wallowing in sin, Adeboye said such people should be ignored because God does not operate the way they are portraying Him.</p><p>“There is woman who said she died and went to heaven where Jesus sent her back to warn people of the world against sin. If you do not know already, when the rich man died and saw Lazarus in the bosom of Abraham, he requested that Father Abraham should send an angel to his relations on earth to warn them to repent and escape hell. He was told that there are enough prophets to accomplish such missions,” Adeboye stressed.</p><p>The cleric explained that anyone who claims to have died and returned to preach the gospel; “please do not listen to them. Put your trust in the true Word of God. Some years ago, one man claimed to have died and came back and he started preaching that any Christian who acquired a car would go to hell.</p><p>“This man produced a CD which he was selling to the people and he made a lot of money from selling the cassettes and CDs. Not long after, he bought a Land Cruiser and when people asked him why was opting for hell, he replied that he did not buy a car. He bought a Land Cruiser. Be careful, you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free,” the RCCG General Overseer said.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnV%2FkWxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
