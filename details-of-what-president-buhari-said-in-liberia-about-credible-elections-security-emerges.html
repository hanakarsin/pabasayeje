In Nigeria, we are working towards a free, fair, transparent, credible and acceptable outcome of elections and their results, it is important and necessary for all our countries to key into these resolves as they are indispensable to peace and stability in our countries and sub-region.</p><p>“The deepening of democracy and good governance are essential antidotes to check-mate unconstitutional change of governments as we sadly witnessed within the last three years in three countries within our sub-region. We must strengthen our efforts to guarantee the irreversibility of democracy in our sub-region and Africa,” he said according to the statement.</p><p>Speaking further, President Buhari used the opportunity to recall Nigeria’s leading roles during the challenges faced by Liberia, particularly in the 90s.</p><p>He said:&nbsp;“Nigeria’s contributions to the survival and safety of Liberia are well known. The dark period of your country’s civil war from 1989 to 1997, was a period that Nigeria invested hugely for peace in Liberia and indeed stability in the rest of the ECOWAS sub-region. May those dark days never re-surface in our countries and sub-region.”</p><p>The Nigerian leader commended his Liberian counterpart, <strong>Dr. George Manneh Weah</strong>, for his demonstration of love for the country and the pursuance of peace, unity and progress, as evidenced by people-oriented projects executed with the sole purpose of taking the country to greater heights within the limited resources available.</p><p>He assured him of Nigeria’s continued support in this regard.</p><p>“Your Excellency’s policy of development launched in 2018 as well as the recently launched youth empowerment program, targeted at comprehensively addressing the problems of youth restiveness in Liberia and equally aimed at rescuing the disadvantaged youths (ZOGOS in local parlance) from drug addictions and other forms of social vices and transforming them into useful members of the Liberian society, are clearly very appropriate policies to lift up the most vulnerable.</p><p>“Permit me to assure you and all Liberians that Nigeria, as a good partner and a dependable ally, would continue to support you in these efforts, within the limit of our resources.</p><p>“This brings to the fore, the need for strengthening and broadening the levels of collaboration and cooperation between our two countries, both bilaterally and multilaterally, within the ECOWAS, AU and the UN, in order to adequately tackle the common national, sub-regional and global challenges.”</p><p>The President of Liberia on his part, thanked President Buhari and other West African leaders for their attendance.</p><p>In particular, Weah appreciated the people of Nigeria for restoring peace to his country, telling Buhari: “thank you Mr. President and the good people of Nigeria. Without your support we would not have had peace.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FvZp2dpJa2rb%2BMqJ1mr5iWwW680Z6qopyVo8FurtShmKuhXaiuqrCMoqVmpJmXsrO1wGaYm6elqXqkvsSdoJuklWKyrbHCraCopqNiwKav1KugrbFdmrqmvsaeqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
