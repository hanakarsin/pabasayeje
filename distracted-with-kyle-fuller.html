After playing D1 basketball for Vanderbuilt University, he played on international teams, including the Peruvian national team and Club Atl√©tico Aguada in Uruguay. After hanging up his jersey, Kyle took to giving motivational speeches online, quickly earning him hundreds of thousands of followers before his debut on The Circle.</p><p>During his season of the hit reality show, Kyle placed second, being a <a href=#>runner-up only to Brandon Baker</a>, who had catfished the athlete as a woman named Olivia.</p><p>Following his reality success and rising internet fame, Kyle took the time to answer 13 quick questions with Distractify.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What was the moment you felt like you had "made it"?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>The moment I felt I made it was when I bought my <a href=#>mom</a> a car after seeing her use the same old red van that used to break down and overheat. She used to have to pull over on the freeway and was never able to use the air conditioner. So when I turned pro and was able to take care of her the way she has always taken care of me and my brother is when I felt I made it.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Kyle Fuller</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your favorite TV show?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>My favorite TV show has to be <a href=#>Martin</a>!! It‚Äôs honestly the funniest TV show on the planet, but a TV show I would love to be a part of would have to be shows produced by 50 Cent like Power. Love his shows and how real they are.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Talk about the best meal you've ever had.</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>Best meal I ever had would have to be Sushi. I don‚Äôt know what it is about sushi but when you say that word in front of me my stomach gets happy. ‚ÄúLet me get a crunchy tuna roll with avocado and cream cheese please!‚Äù</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Shout out one of your favorite fellow creators!</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>Big S/O to @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iamdesibanks</a> because he honestly is the funniest person ever on IG.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kyle Fuller | Miami üìç (@kylefullerofficial)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your most-used emoji?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>The most-used emoji I use is the crying laughing emoji üòÇ because I stay with the jokes. Life is too short to be serious all the time.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Tell us about your dream collaboration.</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>My dream collab would be to get some gym work in with @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">swoleriketts</a> because I‚Äôm all about fitness and pushing your body to the limits.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your go-to karaoke song?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>Go-to song would have to be HYFR by Drake. It‚Äôs a classic that can‚Äôt be beat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kyle Fuller | Miami üìç (@kylefullerofficial)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you could switch lives with any celebrity for a day, who would it be and why?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>It would definitely be <a href=#>Michael B. Jordan</a> because I‚Äôve always wanted to be an actor and I feel he is somebody who is physically built like me and young and ambitious. To see his success is amazing and I would just love to be in his shoes for a day to see what it is like.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's the weirdest or funniest rumor you've heard about yourself?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>The funniest rumor would have to be that I‚Äôm cocky. There‚Äôs a big difference between confident and cocky. Cocky is full of themselves and confident is knowing exactly who you are and being proud of that.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What was your favorite moment on 'The Circle'?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>My favorite moment would have to be when Paul saved me because I truly thought I was going home and instead Paul gave up his game for me to continue.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What is the best feature any social media app could have?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>It would have to be filters because sometimes you just gotta change the way things look or the backdrop sometimes to make it more interesting.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kyle Fuller | Miami üìç (@kylefullerofficial)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Who are your top 5 celebrity crushes?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>Well even though she isn‚Äôt a celebrity I got to still put my wife as number 1. And now for 2-5, I would say:</p><p>2. Ariana Grande</p><p>3. Kylie Jenner</p><p>4. BeyonceÃÅ</p><p>4. Vanessa Hudgens</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>KF: </strong>TV! I love watching TV...a little too much! I played ball all the time and was always so busy, so when I had time to do nothing, I'd just watch TV. That was all I wanted to do.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZqKypJVis7a4y56p</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
