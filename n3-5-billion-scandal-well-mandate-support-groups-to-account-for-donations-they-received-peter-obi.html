We will go from that to other processes, ensuring that we account to those who supported us either in cash or in kind to assure them that their contributions were properly used for the purpose which it was sought for and they graciously, and in some cases, immeasurably supported us. We will also be directing various support groups and bodies that worked for our collective goal of birthing a New Nigeria to do the same by accounting to those who donated to them.</p><p>“We will also show our donors the very visible success we achieved by the judicious management of their resources despite having less than 20 percent of our budget to work with.&nbsp; The generous support of our donors and their unwavering dedication and commitment to the democratic process, which we are committed to, have not gone unnoticed.</p><p>“Despite the challenges and obstacles that came our way, they stood strong and played a crucial role in shaping the future of our nation.
