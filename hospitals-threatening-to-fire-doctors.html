Ming Lin, an emergency room physician in Washington state, was fired by his hospital after he spoke to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">local newspaper</a> about a similar post he made on Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p>In Chicago, nurse Lauri Mazurkiewicz <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was fired</a> when she emailed colleagues complaining about a lack of protective gear. And in New York, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYU Langone</a> Health system sent out an email threatening to dismiss any employee who talks to the media without their permission.&nbsp;</p><p>Mazurkiewicz, the Chicago nurse who was fired, said that she was encouraging colleagues to wear more protective gear because she has asthma and cares for her elderly father.&nbsp;</p><p>“A lot of hospitals are lying to their workers and saying that simple masks are sufficient and nurses are getting sick and they are dying,” she said. “I didn’t want to get infected because I’m not wearing the proper mask and then spread it to my patients and my family."&nbsp;</p><p>The hospital declined to comment because Mazurkiewicz has filed a lawsuit.</p><p>Jim Mandler, a spokesman for NYU Langone Health, told Bloomberg that the policy was to protect patient and staff confidentiality. “Because information is constantly evolving, it is in the best interest of our staff and the institution that only those with the most updated information are permitted to address these issues with the media,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Ruth Schubert, a spokeswoman for the Washington State Nurses Association, told Bloomberg: “Hospitals are muzzling nurses and other health-care workers in an attempt to preserve their image. It is outrageous.”&nbsp;</p><p>She added that in this time of crisis, healthcare workers “must have the ability to tell the public what is really going on inside the facilities where they are caring for CCOVID19 patients."</p><p>Glenn Cohen, faculty director of Harvard Law School’s bioethics center told the publication: “It is good and appropriate for health-care workers to be able to express their own fears and concerns, especially when expressing that might get them better protection. When health-care workers say they are not being protected, the public gets very upset at the hospital system.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the threats, many healthcare workers still seem to be speaking out. This paramedic shared photographs of the mask she's had to wear for days on end, even though they're supposed to be single-use.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Everyone forgets about EMS, we go into peoples homes& apartments & in very small spaces & have to face people with this virus.
