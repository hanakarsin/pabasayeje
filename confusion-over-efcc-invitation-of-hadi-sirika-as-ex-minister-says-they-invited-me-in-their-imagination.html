If they want to invite me, I’m here.”</p><p>When asked whether he went to see Bawa based on his invitation or personally, he said, “I did not get any invitation from the EFCC, Oga, that’s what I said to you. I have not been invited. If I’m invited, it is not any news or no news; I can go whenever I’m invited.</p><p>“If they invite me today, I will appear. I was a public officer and I am accountable for my actions. Public officers are accountable for their actions. If I’m invited by the EFCC, I will go. I’ve not seen any invitation. I am in my house, and I’m based in Abuja, not Kaduna, and they are also here in Abuja.”</p><p>But the spokesman of EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren, told Daily Trust that Sirika had been invited.</p><p>“Yes, that’s what I am telling you, he was invited. I can confirm that there is an ongoing investigation in that regard. I won’t speak further until he confirms his invitation,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH13e5BvZpynnpvCtLXOp2SorpWneqaywpxkoqamnsGiwMiopWanlmK1orDIZqqiqpmgrm6t0macsWWdnruqv9OeqWarka7AbsDHnrBmoZ6rtrWxw2aknmWZo3q1tMSiqWahnZa0qrrAraCopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
