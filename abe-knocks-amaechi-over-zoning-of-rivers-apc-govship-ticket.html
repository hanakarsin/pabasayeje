It was learned that at a meeting with party supporters at Ogu-bolo, Amaechi called on the people of the riverine part of the state to prepare for the zoning of the governorship ticket to the area.
Reacting, Abe disagreed with the minister over the statement, adding that it was too early to talk about which zone will produce the next governorship candidate of the party."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He said that every member of the party will be involved in the decision-making process of the party. But last week, the same minister was in Ogu bolo where he said that the governorship candidate of the party will come from the riverine part of the state. I want to say that the minister’s comment about zoning at Ogu bolo was his personal opinion.</p><p>“He, as an individual cannot determine on his own the area or zone where the party’s governorship candidate will come from. The zoning of APC governorship ticket should be the unanimous and collective decision of all the party members,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5JqZpqalWK4r7vCpKpmmZ2WsqS0yGamr52iYsewusinnmanlmK%2FqsLEq6pmmaCYeqi71ayfoqhdqbakt8StZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
