He was initially married to Mary Adi and the couple were blessed with a baby girl, Gloria in 2013.</p><p>All was going well until Mary, unfortunately, lost her life in 2018. She died during labour while trying to deliver her second pregnancy.</p><p><strong>How Igbu Met Anita</strong></p><p>A year after his wife’s death, Igbu enrolled for a part-time diploma programme at the Nasarawa State Polytechnic. It was during this programme that he met Anita Abu.</p><p>Anita is from Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa state.</p><p>The two fell after sometime, she became pregnant.</p><p><strong>Trouble For Gloria – Igbu’s daughter</strong></p><p>After Anita got pregnant, Igbu narrated that she insisted she would only marry him and keep the pregnancy if Gloria, who was now six years old was eliminated.</p><p>He added that after much pressure and pestering, he agreed to carry out Anita’s wish.</p><p><strong>How The Evil Plan Was Executed</strong></p><p>According to Igbu, Anita on February 12, 2020, at about 12 midnight, mounted heavy pressure on him to throw his daughter into an unused well after she accused the little girl of being behind the numerous bad dreams she was having. She convinced her man that the little girl was a member of a secret cult and a witch as well.</p><p>Igbu on his part, that night, picked up Gloria, who was already fast asleep and dumped her in a well.</p><p>Evil Act Exposed</p><p>A neighbour who wanted to fetch water from the well the next day, discovered Gloria’s lifeless body. He in turn raised the alarm which attracted other members of the community.</p><p>The corpse of the little girl was brought out with the help of neighbours.</p><p>It was during interrogation by members of the community vigilante group who picked Igbu and his fiance, Anita that he confessed to have carried out the evil act.</p><p>“I have since regretted my action. My late wife will never forgive me in her grave. I have betrayed her trust and love; it was the work of the devil.</p><p>“From the first time I met and asked Anita out, she had been complaining over the existence my daughter and just develop hatred for her. She regularly framed up stories about her. I regret buying into her devilish ideas,” he said.</p><p><strong>Anita’s Side Of The Story</strong></p><p>Anita, however, denied ordering his fiance (Mr. Igbu) to kill his daughter as a condition to marrying and keeping his baby.</p><p>She said she only told him she could not live in the same house with her.</p><p>She said, “I told him that if I must marry him, his daughter will have to leave the house, because she always appeared in my dream each time I pass the night in her father’s house.”</p><p>She, however, maintained that the late Gloria was not an ordinary child.</p><p>“Gloria may not be a human being, but killing her was not the best option,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH11e5FvZqaZnmK4qrjLrGShoaNivLi6jJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzedOoZJudXZavrbGMraZmpZGnv7p5wGaqnpufo7Fuw8ifnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
