interest of Nigerians by announcing the removal of the petrol subsidy on May 29, 2023.</p><p>Onanuga said there was no provision for subsidy in the budget left behind by former President Muhammadu Buhari, which prompted Tinubu to act quickly before things got worse.</p><p>Reacting to a statement made by a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, Onanuga said
