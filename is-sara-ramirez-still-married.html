The couple exchanged vows during a beachside wedding held in New York.</p><p>During their marriage, Sara referred to Ryan as their "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">soul mate</a>." As such, fans were surprised when Sara dropped the news in 2021 that the two had split.</p><p>"Ryan and I are no longer together," Sara wrote at the time. "We remain loving and supportive in how we are choosing to forge our new individual paths. Thank you for holding space around our choices and respecting our families‚Äô privacy as we navigate this process on our own terms." Sara then suggested several organizations fans could donate to.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sara Ramirez (@therealsararamirez)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sara came out as bisexual in 2016.</h2><p>Although Sara's character Callie Torres on Grey's Anatomy came out as bisexual on the show back in 2009, Sara didn't come out publicly as queer and bisexual until 2016. The actor did so during a speech at the True Colors Fund's 40 to None Summit.</p><p>"Coming out publicly has given me a sense of relief," Sara told People in 2018. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a form of liberation for me to own all of my identities so that I no longer feel the need to hold back or hide any parts of myself when I walk through any threshold in life.‚Äù</p><p>In reality, though, Sara's coming out has been an ongoing process since she was 18 years old.</p><p>‚ÄúAlthough my caretakers were ill-equipped to support me in the ways that I needed and although I internalized a lot of bi-antagonism and biphobia and discrimination growing up, either in straight spaces or LG spaces, I knew my truth and my truth never went away," she told People.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>The timing of Sara coming out as bisexual came after the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Fla., during which 49 people were killed and 50 others were wounded. It is one of the deadliest attacks against the LGBTQ+ community and Latinos in modern U.S. history ‚Äî and it inspired Sara's decision to go public with their sexuality.</p><p>"Coming out publicly was something that I was afraid of because I was concerned that it would affect my career in a negative way,‚Äù she told People. "I was afraid of the discrimination I might face, not just outside Hollywood, but inside.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>Sara continued, "As I continued to read and hear about the countless forms of violence perpetrated against us, including the Orlando shooting at Pulse nightclub, an organic, incremental urgency to use my platform to empower those who are part of these communities that I‚Äôm a part of came over me in a way that I‚Äôve never felt before."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>New profile pic.
