Gird your loins and your stomachs, and prepare yourselves for the steely gaze and firm handshakes of judge Paul Hollywood, because The Great British Bake Off (GBBO) is finally gifting Americans with new episodes. It has almost been exactly a year since fans of the delicious British competition series were delighted by fellow judge Prue Leith's exquisite taste in both food and chunky necklaces, and we can't wait to gobble up new episodes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Details on the episode release schedule.</h2><p>For information as important as this, we went to one of the few sources we could trust, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Food and Wine</a>, who assures us that Episode 1 of Collection 10 will have its Netflix premiere on Friday, September 16. The remaining nine episodes will drop weekly until the finale, which should air on Friday, November 18. As stated, judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith will be back in the tent with hosts Noel Fielding and <a href=#>Matt Lucas</a>. Joining them is a fresh crop of contestants.</p><p>"This season's competitors range in age from 18 to 60 and hail from a wide mix of backgrounds," reported Food and Wine, which is just how we like it. One thing we can always count on from GBBO is an inclusive roster of participants whose skillsets are equally as diverse. You can never judge someone's talent by their age. Just look at <a href=#>Peter Sawkins</a>, the 2020 winner who took home the title at the tender age of 20.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Let's meet the Collection 10 cast of 'GBBO.'</h2><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Edinburgh Evening News</a> gave us a solid breakdown of all the Collection 10 contestants as the show has already begun in the United Kingdom.
