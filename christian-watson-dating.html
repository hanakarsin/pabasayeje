The 23-year-old wide receiver was dating Lakyn Adkins, but he put a ring on it less than a month before the 2022 NFL Draft. He announced their engagement and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared photos</a> of the proposal on Instagram, captioning the post "4.4.22. - [infinity]." Ugh — that is just so precious!</p><p>The two are college sweethearts — how do we know that? Well, the future Mrs. Watson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a humorous TikTok</a> in March 2022, stating that her younger self always imagined that she would be single during her freshman year of college. The 11-second video then switches to several clips of Christian, indicating that her plans changed once she met him. OK, we're crying.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>She supported him throughout his career as a Bison at North Dakota State, and obviously, nothing has changed since she's always attending Christian's games and cheering him on from the stands (presumably with the other Green Bay Packers WAGs).</p><p>Now, as for her career, several sources claim Lakyn is a cosmetologist; however, she's since taken a break from the profession after moving to Green Bay with Christian. As of now, it seems Lakyn is enjoying her time with Christian and their dog, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mylo</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Christian Watson has been having a stellar rookie season.</h2><p>Since being drafted by the Packers in the 2022 NFL Draft, Christian has had quite an impressive rookie season.</p><p>Although it started rocky, his breakout performance came during the Week 10 matchup against the Dallas Cowboys; he caught four passes for 107 yards and three touchdowns in the Packers 31-28 overtime win. Since then, Christian has delivered several solid performances, which resulted in him being awarded Rookie of the Month in November 2022.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Christian's strong performances have not gone unnoticed by his teammates, especially legendary quarterback <a href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a>. Following the overtime victory over the Cowboys, the 39-year-old QB spoke with reporters and said he was proud of the rookie.</p><p>"We had a lot of plays designed for him, so I don’t think there was any other option," the four-time NFL MVP <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>. "I think that (first touchdown) probably on the atomic level shifted a lot of different things for him, exorcising some energetic demons. I’m proud of him. He made some plays."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWztdKtoJqmXayutb%2FOp2SdmaSeu6g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
