She attended the concert with a group of friends who later told police she didn't drink at all that evening, as she was meeting with her personal trainer early the next morning. When Carpenter-Koklich didn't show up, that was the first indication something was not right. She was never seen again. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What happened to Jana Carpenter-Koklich</a>? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Jana Carpenter-Koklich? Ask her husband.</h2><p>Carpenter-Koklich's mother was concerned about the fact that her daughter didn't make it to the gym that day. She hadn't skipped a personal trainer session in two years. After leaving several unanswered messages on her daughter's answering machine, Janeth Carpenter's dread continued to grow.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Bruce Koklich worked with his wife at RE/MAX International Inc.'s Seal Beach Office in California, and began worrying about Carpenter-Koklich when she didn't show up for work on Monday August 20. When speaking with police, Koklich said he had a busy weekend and hadn't notice when his wife skipped her training session, claiming he saw her that Monday morning between 6:00 and 6:30 a.m. By 11:00 a.m. when she hadn't arrived at work, that's when Koklich began to worry.</p><p>She was reported missing but authorities could find no evidence of foul play until Carpenter-Koklich's abandoned car was found on Aug. 27. Teenagers had stumbled upon it a week prior and took it for a spin. The windows had been rolled down, and her purse as well as a gun were inside. They ditched the purse and sold the gun, then alerted cops a week later when they realized the vehicle was part of an investigation. When police were able to take a look, they found the backseat covered in blood.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Where is Bruce Koklich now?</h2><p>This was a high profile case as Carpenter-Koklich was the daughter of Democratic state Sen. Paul Carpenter of Cypress, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Los Angeles Times</a>. Ten days after she went missing, Koklich <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">agreed to take a polygraph test</a> but he never showed up. This roused suspicion in police who were already curious about Koklich's theory that his wife's car had been carjacked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>After police found trace amounts of Carpenter-Koklich's blood in the couple's bedroom, they arrested Koklich on Jan. 31, 2002 and charged him with murder. It would later be revealed that Koklich took out a $1 million life insurance policy on his wife. Her parents were aware of the fact that Koklich had engaged in various affairs with sex workers, which is why Carpenter-Koklich wanted a divorce. If that happened, he stood to lose 51 percent of their business.</p><p>Koklich was eventually convicted and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. As of the time of this writing, he is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">incarcerated at the California Institution for Men</a>. Koklich's next parole hearing is tentatively scheduled for sometime in June 2028. Carpenter-Koklich's body was never found, which was particularly devastating for her mother who told the Los Angeles Times, "There are no words to describe the loneliness I feel without Jana’s presence in my life."</p><p>For more on this story, watch Homicide: Los Angeles which is currently available to stream on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjmZ6WeqSt0amcp6yVp3qsu8qloJyg</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
