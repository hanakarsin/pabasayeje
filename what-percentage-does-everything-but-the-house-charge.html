Of course, the next step would be to make a shop centered on decluttering houses, and <a href=#><u>Everything But the House</u></a> does just that. The series ‚Äî which uses the website and company of the same name to help people get rid of unwanted items in their homes ‚Äî focuses on implementing a "less is more" sort of mantra.</p><p>Think of it as a flea market or garage sale online and on TV, wherein people sell their belongings. But the real question is how much the company Everything But the House charges people on the show. Because, as you might expect, selling your items through the website isn't free, and there are some costs you'll accrue no matter how much your stuff sells for.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: EBTH.com</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">So, what percentage does 'Everything But the House' charge?</h2><p>The show Everything But the House is reliant on the payment structure of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>. So, if we're going by what the website says, there are different tiers regarding what the company will take as a commission from each sale you post. On the show, viewers have seen tons of different items go for a variety of different prices. But unless you make a decent amount on any given sale, you could potentially make nothing.</p><p>For example, if one item sells for up to $30, Everything But the House earns 100 percent in commission. Any final sale on items from $31 to $60 means a $30 commission for the company. From there, different percentages are determined by what your items sell for. And, as with any sale through a company wherein the business takes a cut, there are some differences in tiers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by EVERYTHING BUT THE HOUSE (@ebth)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">You can also buy unwanted items on the website that inspired 'Everything But the House.'</h2><p>If you want to buy items rather than sell everything in your home, you can do it on the Everything But the House website. From designer clothing and accessories to original artwork and furniture, you can place bids on pretty much anything. It's like eBay, but for those who have had liquidation sales from their homes.</p><p>Everything that's listed on the site starts at $1 and, of course, goes up from there, depending on how much each potential buyer bids on a listing. Items can get into the hundreds, depending on how valuable they are, but there are also lesser priced things you may need that you can bid on yourself. And for heavier products, you are expected to pay whatever increased shipping costs are incurred.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Checked out Everything But The House recommended by <a href=#>@DayDrinkingPod</a> My mom and I love this show! Loved the history behind the items that are found. It reminds me of an old Uk show called Bargain Hunt.
