We, therefore, warn that care must be taken to balance our quest for membership with the interest the Party advances to fight corruption, a cardinal objective for which the Nigerian electorate welcomed us in 2015.</p><p>“Our group is concerned that, it seems that men and women, who have been accused of perpetrating all manner of official sleaze, corruption and stealing, now feel that the only thing to do to be allowed to continue to “enjoy” their loot is to jump into the saving sheep of the ruling Party. We must not encourage this mindset in order not&nbsp; to toe the ignominious path of the PDP.”</p><p>Ahead of the&nbsp; APC&nbsp; national convention to elect a new set of national officers, the group asked stakeholders of the ruling party to zone the position of national chairman to the North Central zone.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Naija News</a></strong> recalls some prominent PDP chieftains have recently dumped the party to pitch their tent with the APC.</p><p>The gale of defections has included Ebonyi State governor, <strong>Dave Umahi</strong> as well as his counterparts in Zamfara State, <strong>Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle</strong> and <strong>Professor Ben Ayade</strong> of Cross River.</p><p>Many National Assembly lawmakers have also joined the governors in defecting to the APC ahead of the 2023 general elections.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5BpZqynnZp6sbDPZqSepZKav7R5yaigp6GenHqwwdFmp5qqpK56tbuMnqqcmaCaeqe%2BzqZknp6TmHqivMJmnqunpaV6tbHLpapmmqWjtnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
