"It’s given my life a depth of purpose and joy to know that our words were well received. That in the most subtle and sometimes sublime ways, what we offered helped you to fulfill your best life. To dream bigger. Dare greater. See things differently. Love yourself more."</p><p>She continued, "As I look forward beyond this final monthly print edition, my intention is to continue serving up what you most need now to better your health, relationships, work life, and home life, and to reach for the dreams you still dream. Nothing stays the same — that I also know for sure. And 20 years in this format I consider a solid run, well done."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpHqurcaasaKmlWKyr7DIp54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
