Naija News understands that this is seen as a significant victory for Atiku in his ongoing push to demonstrate Bola Tinubu’s ineligibility to be Nigeria’s president.
The federal court in Chicago on Tuesday night directed CSU to turn over all records relating to Tinubu to Atiku, saying the former vice-president has sufficiently satisfied the purpose for seeking the records."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The parties can modify the dates set by the court by mutual agreement. Given the tight time frame under which the parties are operating, the deposition can, if necessary, occur on a non-weekday.”</p><p>Recall that on August 2nd, Atiku had filed an application for the court to order CSU to produce documents relating to Tinubu, as well as leave to get the school’s administrators to authenticate any documents submitted under oath.</p><p>He said the documents would be part of his ongoing challenge against Tinubu’s election earlier this year. The former Vice President noted that Tinubu should not have been allowed to run for president because he had submitted a forged document under oath violating the Nigerian Constitution.</p><p>Section 137 (1)(j) of the Nigerian Constitution (amended in 2010) specifically stated that no one would be legitimately elected president of Nigeria if the person “has presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH16e5FpZpuqlZa4qrrGZqysZZOkwrPAjKucqaeiqbKluNhmpquclafAbq%2FHopqan59iwq%2B11Z6prKGkrnq1u4yrnKWdkaiybsDIp6ybraNirqStw56koptdp7Kku9Gdqmasn2KutbXKrmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
