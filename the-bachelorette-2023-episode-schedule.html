However, this season looked slightly different, as the first four episodes aired at 9 p.m. EST. But the show reverts to its typical 8 p.m. time slot with the July 24 episode.</p><p>The reason for the time change in the first handful of episodes? Well, Season 2 of <a href=# style=text-align:start><strong>Claim to Fame</strong></a> took over its usual 8 p.m. time slot. Now, Claim to Fame will move over to Mondays at 10 p.m., and The Bachelorette returns — <a href=#>much to fans' delight</a> — to its usual place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecGamqGdnKS%2FpsDTnmRraGJoeqa8yKymnZ1dqLCpscOuo54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
