APC today can’t win any state in the South East or South South. If elections are held today, APC will not win Lagos State. If the party is lucky, it may win in Ekiti and Ogun. In Osun, Ondo and Oyo, the PDP will battle the APC. That leaves the APC with limited options.</p><p class=p4><span class=s1>“President Muhammadu Buhari will not be on the ballot in 2023. That means Atiku will be the first choice of the North. Atiku will win in the North East. He will win too in North West because of the large number of Hausa and Fulani there.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>“PDP’s main foot soldiers are in North Central. APC is not sure of winning that geopolitical zone. It is more difficult now because of the new Electoral Act. The era of writing results in Government House is gone. If votes count, APC will be in trouble.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>“As for the PDP, how can Atiku win if the entire South East and South South don’t vote for him? As popular as Buhari was, he lost elections three times until the South voted for him.</span></p><p class=p4><span class=s1>“These are the issues. I doubt if Obi will win. I don’t see that possibility, but he is causing a serious upset in the two major parties- APC and the PDP.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FrZmtoYmh6sK7IrGSpqpWotqWxza2gmqRdlrqjtdOipqdlpJ2%2Fpq3TZquoZaSeu7au1GaYraGbqnqivMJmo5qvnZa4pr6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
