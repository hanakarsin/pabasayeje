Source: Niantic via @mike_ptm on TwitterThough the developers of Pok√©mon GO have repeatedly made elusive and powerful Pok√©mon (including Legendary and Mythical Pok√©mon) available in the game, there are some that are still particularly difficult to capture in the game.
Thankfully, Deoxys, one of these extremely elusive yet incredibly powerful Pok√©mon, will be available to capture during the Pok√©mon GO Season of Light."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Players will even be able to capture all of its four formes ‚Äî but can you get a shiny Deoxys during this time?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Can you get a shiny Deoxys in 'Pok√©mon GO'?</h2><p>For the start of September, all four of Deoxy's different formes will appear as <a href=#>raid bosses</a> in Pok√©mon GO ‚Äî and serious collectors will want to hop on this opportunity to capture the incredibly rare Pok√©mon, as it's rarely available in the game. This also means that players will want to try to catch its shiny variant during this period, as it may be some time before the powerful Pok√©mon appears in the game again.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Niantic via Twitter</a></figure><p>While not all of the different formes previously had shiny versions available in Pok√©mon GO, for the Season of Light event in September 2022, players will have a chance to catch all shiny versions of Deoxys. Normal Deoxys' shiny variant was added to the game in August 2020, while the Attack, Speed, and Defense Formes all received shiny variants in February 2022.</p><p>Since all four formes are only available between Sept. 1‚Äì13, there will be a very small window of time for players to capture the shiny versions of this Pok√©mon ‚Äî so you'll want to act quickly and really grind to catch them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Still reading up on all of the amazing <a href=#>#SeasonOfLight</a> news? üåå</p><p>Here‚Äôs an infographic to help visualize some of the raids, spectacular in-game events, and out-of-this-world surprises that are coming this Season!</p><p>Tag a friend who might need it! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CkOt0la6TU</a></p>‚Äî Pok√©mon GO (@PokemonGoApp) <a href=#>August 30, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Which Deoxys Forme is the best?</h2><p>Of the four different formes of Deoxys you can catch, each of them has different IVs that make them better suited for different parts of battle. Here's a breakdown of the different stats:</p><ul style=text-align:start><li><strong>Normal Deoxys</strong> ‚Äì Attack: 345, Defense: 115, Stamina: 137, Max CP: 3573</li><li><strong>Attack Deoxys</strong> ‚Äì Attack: 414, Defense: 46, Stamina: 137, Max CP: 2916</li><li><strong>Defense Deoxys</strong> ‚Äì Attack: 144, Defense: 330, Stamina: 137, Max CP: 2570</li><li><strong>Speed Deoxys</strong> ‚Äì Attack: 230, Defense: 218, Stamina: 137, Max CP: 3255</li></ul><p>While it would be easy to argue that Normal or Speed Deoxys are some of the better formes of this Pokemon, since so much of battling in Pokemon GO is centered around being able to withstand plenty of attacks from an opponent, Defense Deoxys' 330 defense stat makes it a great contender ‚Äî especially if you use its type to your advantage while in battle.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>5th defense form Deoxys and my best Deoxys IV wise!! üòÅüòÅ<a href=#>#PokemonGO</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ttnGgHpK8t</a></p>‚Äî Komodo Lord #ShinyMasterDex (@KomodoLord) <a href=#>June 3, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to catch shiny Deoxys.</h2><p>For all four formes of Deoxys, you'll need to participate in five-star raids as they become available. The shiny version of this Pok√©mon has a yellow body instead of Deoxys' usual red exterior, and while the shiny version doesn't offer any additional stat bonuses, they're still essential to collect for any Pok√©mon connoisseur.</p><p>Unfortunately, though Deoxys has a boosted shiny spawn rate of 5% versus the traditional 0.2% of other Pok√©mon, you're still not likely to find it on your first encounter.</p><p>This means that you'll likely have to participate in multiple five-star raids in a day during this window, so you'll need to be sure you have a stockpile of Premium Raid Passes.</p><p>Once you've defeated Deoxys during a raid at your local gym, you'll be given an opportunity to capture it to add to your own collection. You may have to go to different gyms to find the different formes of Deoxys, especially if you're shiny hunting them.</p><p>If the Deoxys that appears following the end of your raid is not a shiny Deoxys, unfortunately you will have to participate in another five-star raid for another chance to find its shiny variant.</p><p>Remember, the quicker you defeat the Pok√©mon in a raid, the more Premiere Balls you're awarded to capture it with. Team up with friends to complete raids quicker and give yourself a higher chance at catching this particularly powerful Mythical Pok√©mon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmK6vediorGaflal6tLTIp7BmnJWkxbq%2FjKmmpJ2dpLtus84%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
