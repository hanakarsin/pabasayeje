Democracy dies when political elites repudiate or reject the norms and values on which democracy is practised and the judiciary is captured and unable to do Electoral justice.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FyZpuqlZa4qrrGZpuipp9iuqa4wLKcZqugmq6sv4yopWabmJa5rbHNoKCnn12gvKi1jJ6jnpuknryvedGeqq6kpGKutXnTq6CbrZ6WuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
