You look at it and two wins and you would be in the top half of the table.</p><p>“For Aston Villa, what their target is in their third year back in the Premier League, I would say seventh or eighth. With the money they have spent, the time he has had to get a team together, and the squad.</p><p>“Being 19th in the table and not playing that well, I don’t think the fans are prepared to accept it or the owners. Aston Villa is too big a club to be 19th in the Premier League.”</p><p>The Welsh man asserts that a disagreement between Gerrard and the owners resulted in the two-line, succinct statement that announced the manager’s dismissal.</p><p>“It was a bit sharp, wasn’t it? I thought he would make it to breakfast, but they have just slashed his legs off,” he went on.</p><p>“I have managed six teams and been sacked twice. First time I got sacked I got a phone call the next day. The second time was right after a game, and I said ‘can’t you wait until Monday?’ It’s a knee jerk reaction.</p><p>“I am trying to work out why it has been so quick. It sounds like he has had an argument with them and has gone ‘well sack me if you like’; it was a bit quick.” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FqZpqrpKS7bsLIpaOaZZyatKa6w2acsaiclravv4ywn7Jlo6myt7HNZp6eqqKWv6V51pqqZquRmLimsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
