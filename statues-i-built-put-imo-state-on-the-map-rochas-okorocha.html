The innovations put Imo State on the map.”</p><p>“We never had an identity because there was no tourism, there was absolutely nothing.</p><p>“Then I came with the ingenuity of tourism and I developed a place called Heroes Square. The statues are just in a part of the entire square.</p><p>“The statues brought President Zuma to Imo State, beating the entire protocol of Imo not having an International Airport.</p><p>“Nana Akufo-Addo flew from Ghana to Owerri without passing through Abuja, because of the statues.</p><p>“Ellen Johnson Sirleaf flew all the way from Liberia as a sitting president. In fact, she came from America.”</p><p>Okorocha said the statues brought lots of tourism to Imo, adding that “there’s no Christmas without thousands of people gathered around those statues.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ze49xZqyskanCpr%2BMomSbrZmhwW681K1koqWfYsC1rdOeZKimXam1pnnMmqdmqp%2BYtaK%2FjKiiqKqfmLWiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
