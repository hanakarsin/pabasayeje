For these kind of shows that often sell out quickly, some will find themselves paying many times the original price of a ticket to go to a show (or go without if they can't afford it)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

For these kind of shows that often sell out quickly, some will find themselves paying many times the original price of a ticket to go to a show (or go without if they can't afford it).</p><p>Because of this, <a href=#>Ticketmaster</a> has created the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Verified Fan</a>" experience, where fans would be given an early access period to purchase tickets by manually entering a code provided by the company, thus proving they aren't a bot.</p><p>But implementing this "Verified Fan" experience has only seemed to frustrate fans, as there are often technical difficulties. In fact, there was a huge uproar after Verified Fans struggled to secure tickets in late 2021 to see <a href=#>Olivia Rodrigo</a>. Even with that history, Ticketmaster didn't iron out all these kinks before opening the presale for <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>'s <a href=#>Eras tour</a> in late 2022.</p><p>So, how do you become a Verified Fan? What does being a verified fan get you?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to be a Verified Fan on Ticketmaster.</h2><p>For certain artists or shows where Ticketmaster is anticipating a high demand, to prevent scalpers from purchasing tickets for resale, the company has a "Verified Fan" registration. This requires fans to register their account as a fan of the artist through a quick registration form to prevent bots from purchasing the tickets when they go on sale.</p><p>Each artist's registration process will be slightly different, so if you're wondering whether or not you'll need to pre-register for a show, check the artist's social media accounts ahead of the ticket sales or Ticketmaster's social media.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Ticketmaster (@ticketmaster)</a></p></figure><p>Unfortunately, just filling out the registration to become a Verified Fan doesn't automatically grant you access to the presale for the show you're interested in. If the demand for tickets is high enough, there's a chance that Ticketmaster will waitlist you for the Verified Fan designation.</p><p>If this happens, you'll be notified via text message a few days before the sale if you've been pulled from the waitlist, which will then grant you permission to access the tickets. Even then (as we've seen with past tours), being Verified isn't a total guarantee of purchasing tickets. However, in this ever-competitive world of acquiring concert tickets, fans will take any little advantages they can get.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZJudXZZ6t7HRop2inZRis6K6jKilZqyZmLimwMyaqq2dog%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
