Consequently, students are currently taking lectures or writing examinations that were disrupted during the strike of the ASUU.</p><p>“Therefore, having regard to the facts and circumstances of the ASUU strike the doctrine of ‘no work, no pay’ is totally inapplicable as students who were not taught during the strike are currently attending lectures and writing examinations.</p><p>“Furthermore, it is public knowledge that the members of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) embarked on a strike that lasted two months last year. The federal government dragged the striking doctors to the national industrial court which ordered the NARD to call off the strike. As soon as the strike was called off, President Muhammadu Buhari jettisoned the ‘no work, no pay’ principle and ordered the payment of the salaries for the two months that the strike lasted.</p><p>“On that occasion, the President overruled Dr. Ngige in the interest of industrial harmony in the health sector.</p><p>“In the same vein, the ASUU recently called off its 8-month-old strike in compliance with the order of the national industrial court and the court of appeal. We are therefore compelled to call on President Buhari should ignore the advice of Dr. Ngige and direct the public universities to pay the full salary of each lecturer from February to October 2022.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49vZp2ho5i%2FqrnIp5itp6Kueqq4y56emqRdm66trc2aZJqrm6h6o8HHmqmiZaSkeqqzzaipnmWenLaosYypmLJlkajCtnnFrqOlZaOWuaK%2B2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
