Madappa works at an animal welfare organization called CUPA in their city, according to BuzzFeed News. In her time there, she's adopted a number of dogs, but after she got pregnant, that became a problem for a lot of people.</p><p>In a now viral Facebook post, Madappa explained why she would not be giving up her dogs when the baby comes, despite urging from the people around her.</p><p>"Being in animal welfare, one of the most common reasons I hear for giving up a pet is 'I'm pregnant,'" said Madappa. "When I have tried to counsel these families, i get it thrown back in my face that since I don't have children and haven't experienced a pregnancy, I don't get to have an opinion."&nbsp;</p><p>Well, now that she is, her mind hasn't changed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Madappa had a very difficult pregnancy; her morning sickness was so bad she was throwing up blood and had to be hospitalized. She was considered high risk and had to remain at home. The only thing that got her through was her pups:</p>"My dogs are the reason i got through my pregnancy with my sanity intact. The days i spent crying, I had the comforting weight of Diego's head on my lap reassuring me things would be ok. the nights i spent on the bathroom floor, Leo kept me company, gently pawing me now and then to see if i was okay. I lost a very special little girl along the way, Leela, who kept me smiling with her silly antics till the end. When i could finally fall asleep, I had Cujo resting at my feet. I couldn't afford to stay in bed feeling sorry for myself when i had these kids depending on me."<p>Now that her son is born, Madappa is even more sure she could never give away her dogs.</p><p>"I couldn't ever in good conscience give away an animal that loves me and trusts me with the same innocence and purity that my baby does. I couldn't abandon a family member to bring in another. I will not betray a life that depends on me as much as my son does," she said, adding, "NOT WITHOUT MY DOGS."</p><p>To emphasize their point, Madappa and Raheja even did a maternity photo shoot with all these loyal canines, and it is absolutely adorable.</p><p>Here's the traditional outdoor scene, with everyone looking groomed and photo ready:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Here's a glimpse into how much these adoring dogs love their human mom:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Everyone is extremely impatient for the new family member to arrive:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Taking care of mom and baby bro:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Look at this proud and excited dog family!
