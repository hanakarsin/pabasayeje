From <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Durham probe</a>, to America's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"weak" response in evacuating US citizens in Afghanistan</a>, many are stating that foreign nations have exploited the positions the US has taken which led to the current crisis in Ukraine.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But why do some people refer to the country as "The Ukraine?"</h2><p>The crisis in Ukraine (as of this writing" is one of the most massively covered stories with tons of people chiming in. You may have noticed that there are tons of folks referring to the nation as "The Ukraine" but it's a moniker that Ukrainians would more than likely want to forget as it hearkens back to the days of The Soviet Union.</p><p>The country fought for its sovereignty independent of Russia for a very long time and there's a long, bloody history associated with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ukraine and Communism</a>. Under the Soviet Union, specific territories, like Ukraine would have a "The" placed in front of it, which marked its affiliation with The Soviet Union, hence, "The Ukraine."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>The Soviet Union collapsed on December 26, 1991, but Ukraine gained independence prior to that on August 24, 1991. From that day forward, the nation was known as "Ukraine."</p><p>So if one calls it "The Ukraine" it's calling back to a time many citizens in the country would most probably want to forget. It'd sort of be like calling America "The Colonies" some 21 years after the Revolutionary War.</p><p>Sure that might sound like a joke now given the fact that we're so far removed from US Independence by hundreds of years and given the fact that America has managed to become a popular world power (although much has been written about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"decline" of the United States.</a>)</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The largest demonstration in the modern history of Estonia took place in support of Ukraine.
