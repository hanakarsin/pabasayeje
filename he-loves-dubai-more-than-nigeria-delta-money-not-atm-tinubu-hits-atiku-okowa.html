Revenue from oil and gas has historically been the backbone of government revenue and foreign exchange earnings.</p><p>“As such your state and other oil producers have made a one-of-a-kind financial contribution to the building of modern Nigeria. The nation is thankful to you.</p><p>“Delta has all it takes to be great and help lead the nation forward. Yet, for the past twenty-three years, those governing your state have taken you for a hard and long ride by selling you short. They have not done the things they should have and could have done for you.</p><p>“The infrastructure in the state was better 30 years ago than it is now. The state has recorded historic debts run up by the incumbent yet the infrastructure and other things still remain lacking because of under investment and neglect.</p><p>“The money is much but it does not have legs. Where did it go? Not to your welfare. Perhaps, it has found a home with a certain presidential candidate who loves Dubai more than Nigeria. But Delta State is not an ATM for migratory politicians. It is a place where good and hardworking people reside and work to create decent and peaceful lives for themselves and their families.”</p><p>The rally was attended by many APC chieftains including&nbsp;Senate President Ahmad Lawan, APC Deputy National Chairman, South, Barrister Emma Enekwu, representing National Chairman Abdullahi Adamu, the Vice Presidential candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima and his wife, Nana Shettima, and Senator Oluremi Tinubu.</p><p>Others were the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinnma, Governor of Plateau State and Director-General of the Tinubu presidential campaigns, Simon Lalong, Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege who is also Delta State governorship candidate of the party, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Idris Wase, members of the APC National Working Committee, Ministers including Youth and Sports, Sunday Akin Dare, and Labour & Employment (State), Festus Keyamo SAN and former governor of Edo State and Edo North APC Senatorial Candidate, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole.</p><p>Speaking at the rally, APC Governorship candidate in Delta, Senator Omo-Agege, said Okowa should step down as Governor, accusing him of failing the people of the state.</p><p>He also urged the people of the state to vote for Tinubu and all APC candidates in the 2023 general elections.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye5ByZqGdXaG8t7HSZpuumpGeeq670Z5kraCRo3qvtcaeqaKZXZmyrcDAZqSoppWueq%2B702aYraVdqbavwcGuZKGhpKh6osDIpKxmp5ukxKJ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
