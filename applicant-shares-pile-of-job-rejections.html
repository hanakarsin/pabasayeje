Across social media, people have been reflecting on how difficult it is to get a job offer. As <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">one frustrated Twitter user wrote</a>, "Why is it so hard to get a job? I'm truly fighting for my life out here."</p><p>You see, the problem doesn't appear to be that jobseekers aren't applying to enough places, but rather they're getting rejected more. Don't believe me? One <a href=#>TikTok</a> user based in Toronto showed off all the rejection emails they had received and oof. It's brutal out there.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter / @galaxy_rae</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A job applicant shows off all the rejection emails they received from Indeed.</h2><p>In June 2023, TikTok creator <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@certibodmon</a> shared a slideshow of all the rejection emails they'd received from the online job board <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indeed</a>. In the background, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"another one thank you" audio</a> by <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">@notukam</a> played, which perfectly captured the mood. "How am I supposed to be outside with no job?" they wrote in the caption.</p><p>The rejections came from major food and retail franchises like <a href=#>Dairy Queen</a> and <a href=#>Chipotle</a>, and H&M. @certibodmon later added "Bro, even <a href=#>McDonald's</a> never called me back."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok / @certibodmon</a></figure><p>In the comment section, users felt for @certibodmon. In fact, many folks appeared to be a similar situation. "I'm literally lowering my standards to apply for these jobs and I'm still getting rejected," wrote one person.</p><p>Another reflected on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canada's labor shortage</a>, claiming, "This can't be the same country going through a worker shortage."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok</span></figure><p>Other users tried to offer up some advice to those struggling to find work. "You honestly gotta go in person," wrote one user, claiming you're more likely to get noticed if you apply in person. In fact, another person suggested that they bring their r√©sum√© to the mall and drop it off in different stores.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">A woman claims she applied to over 500 jobs and still couldn't get a job.</h2><p>If you thought @certibodmo was having a difficult time job hunting in Canada, wait until you hear <a href=#>this woman's story</a>. While she's based in the United States where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the unemployment rate</a> is usually either equal to or slightly lower than <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canada's</a>, she was still struggling.</p><p>Under the TikTok username <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">@directionally_yours,</a> she explained in a video that she had applied to 503 jobs within the last six months and had yet to secure a full-time position.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@directionally_yours href=#>@directionally_yours</a><p>1.

In fact, it almost seemed like they were taking advantage of her as two companies made her go through multiple rounds of interviews before passing on her.</p><p>And while we don't know exactly what type of jobs she was applying to, she did mention that she had a bachelor's and master's degree.</p><p>In the comment section, other users seemed to be in the same boat.</p><p>‚ÄúI have two masters ...
