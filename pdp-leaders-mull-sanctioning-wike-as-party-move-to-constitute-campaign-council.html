We have been reaching out to our members nationwide, including our respected leaders in Rivers State.</p><p>“Details of our next steps are being worked out. You know the PDP, being a very large family, has a lot of tendencies and individuals and groups have egos that require massaging. We are doing that.</p><p>“There are those pushing for us to wield the big stick but the majority are more favourably disposed to ongoing reconciliatory efforts because we are in opposition; we need everyone more than the ruling party.”</p><p>Another party leader, who spoke on grounds of anonymity, said: “The PDP has dealt with bigger challenges; this one too has come and it will go. Governor Wike, whose name is being mentioned anytime our current challenges are cited, is a party man, he has said it himself.</p><p>“He has other party leaders who respect him and look up to him to protect their political interests. Whatsoever those interests may be, he feels an obligation to protect those who stuck out their necks for him during his bid for the ticket.</p><p>“It is the pursuit of this that has delayed us till now but we must make progress; we have an election to win and there will be positions of responsibilities to be given out. It is the patience component that is the issue at the moment.”</p><p>Also speaking, the Media Adviser to the PDP Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, Paul Ibe said progress is being made with regard to resolving outstanding issues rocking the party.</p><p>“My principal has assured the party and all members that everyone will be carried along. That commitment has not changed,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5BqZqmcoGK5pq3DnqmsZZ2qua150pqlnKyZpLuqusZmrqKjlWKutHnPmqmtsV2ivLexjK2mZpufo8C1tdOuq55lk5a6sa3IoKVmm5%2Bqu6S1y2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
