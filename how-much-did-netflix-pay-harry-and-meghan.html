In an interview with Netflix's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tudum</a>, Liz expressed her appreciation with being to able to work with the royal couple for exclusive interviews for the series.</p><p>"It has been a privilege to be able to work with Harry and Meghan, who bravely allowed themselves to be vulnerable by sharing their personal stories and archive," she tells Tudum.</p><p>But being able to sit down with the royal couple for extensive interviews is no easy feat. Even after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harry</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meghan</a> stepped away from their royal standings in an unprecedented bid for financial independence, the two are still an absurdly high-profile couple among the royal family with a combined net worth of over $120 million. That being said, Netflix's deal with the two of them certainly didn't come cheap.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, Netflix's Harry & Meghan docuseries is part of a five-year $100 million contract with the royal couple to produce exclusive documentaries, films, and even children's programming. The deal was signed in September 2020, placing the new show squarely within the time frame of the contract.</p><p>Even without the financial backing of the British Commonwealth, their celebrity status will undoubtedly ensure their lofty financial standing for some time.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>It can be said that through this first production of their lucrative Netflix deal, Harry and Meghan seek to clear the air about their scandalous relationship and the controversies they've invited throughout the years. In a statement to Tudum, the Duke and Duchess Sussex confess: "We are grateful to have the ability to share our love story through such an esteemed creative team and with the global reach of Netflix. We hope it helps others to heal, and to feel inspired."</p><p>Liz Garbus echoes this sentiment, stating, "I hope that when Netflix viewers press play, whatever preconceptions people have, they will be open to the discovery of what we've shared in this documentary series. It's an incredible love story set against the context of huge stakes and their journey is a historical event that will be examined for a long time to come."</p><p>Volume II of Harry & Meghan begins streaming on Netflix starting Dec. 15.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyumqFllJ6xbrrErZ2loahivaLFjKGYq6qpYq6vsIymnKCgkaM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
