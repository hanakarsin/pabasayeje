In a series of tweets on May 12, 2024, Soulja Boy went after <a href=#>Metro Boomin</a> in exactly that way, but he also left some details about exactly what happened to Metro's mother unclear.</p><p>While these tweets may have crossed a line for some, many were left wondering what the beef was over, and why Soulja Boy had chosen to call out Metro's mom the way he did. Here's what we know about what happened to her.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What happened to Metro Boomin's mom?</h2><p>Metro's mother died in 2022 in what appeared to be a murder-suicide perpetrated by Metro's stepfather.</p><p>It's obviously a tragic incident, and it's one that Soulja Boy invoked as part of a series of tweets on May 12. Soulja Boy's tweets were in response to a tweet that Metro sent more than a decade ago after Soulja Boy asked Metro and 21 Savage to sign a boxing contract.</p><p>"My phone rings to come to the studio with Jeezy," Metro wrote in 2012. "Yours rings to send Soulja Boy a pack of beats. Sit down."</p><p>Now, 12 years later, Soulja Boy is apparently ready to respond. On May 11, he responded in an Instagram live, and the next day, he sent a series of tweets that called out both Metro and his late mother.</p><p>He started by wishing Metro happy Mother's Day, and then wrote in a subsequent tweet "You sacrificed your own mom <a href=# style=text-align:inherit rel="noopener noreferrer">@MetroBoomin,</a> you a puppet [sic]."</p><p>In additional tweets, Soulja Boy seemed to suggest that he didn't care about the negative reaction to his decision to go after Metro's mother on Mother's Day.</p><p>"I don’t give a f--k! It’s always cool when a n---a come at me, but when I defend myself it’s too much, huh?! F--k that n---a mama! Don’t speak on my name, b---h!" he wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You sacrificed your own mom <a href=#>@MetroBoomin</a> you a puppet</p>— Soulja Boy (Draco) (@souljaboy) <a href=#>May 12, 2024</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@souljaboy</span></figure><p>In another tweet, he suggested that Metro had sacrificed his mother for his own money and fame.</p><p>“All the streams, sales, money, and fame not gone bring your mom back @MetroBoomin, was it worth it [sic]?" he wrote. "I can say f--k this money and fame s--t and still be a boss, can you?”</p><p>Soulja Boy clearly wasn't planning to take any prisoners in his barrage of attacks.</p><p>Understandably, Soulja Boy got a lot of pushback for the personal ways he chose to go after Metro, and for his poor timing. It seems unlikely that this will be the end of this beef, especially since Soulja Boy also called out 21 Savage.</p><p>What comes next between them isn't clear, but Soulja Boy is facing more blowback than he may have expected. On his own Twitter page, Metro simply wished his mother a Happy Mother's Day, which contrasted nicely with the personal way that Soulja Boy had chosen to go after him for a decade-old tweet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSmnaSnvG6uzqikoqZdoryu</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
