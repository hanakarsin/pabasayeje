Conspiracy theories are a dime a dozen on Twitter, and the rumor mill recently buzzed with reports that former President Barack Obama bought the social media app Parler.
If he did, then Parler — a favored platform among conservatives and the far right — would have at least one blue backer amid a sea of red supporters."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Parler is people and privacy-focused, and gives you the tools you need to curate your Parler experience.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Parler on YouTube</a></figure><p>As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a> reported in June 2020, the platform has become a “Twitter for conservatives” — an alternative to social media platforms that have flagged policy-violating messages from Donald Trump and other politicians. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Newsweek</a>, the app “offers a space for the far right.”</p><p>High-profile users include Trump’s former campaign director Brad Parscale, the president’s son Eric Trump, and White House <a href=#>press secretary Kayleigh McEnany</a>.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>As of the time of the Fortune article, Parler had an estimated total audience of 2 million users, compared to Twitter’s 166 million daily average users and Facebook’s 1.7 billion.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Did Barack Obama really buy Parler?</h2><p>Apparently, some Twitter users think that former<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> President Obama bought Parler</a> through a front company and that’s why the app hasn’t been working properly.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>But Dan Bongino dispelled the rumors on Sunday, Nov. 8. “Parler has NOT been sold,” he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “I assure you, as an owner of the company, that if we sold it, I would know! Parler has exploded. We’re adding thousands of users per minute and were working out the glitches as a result. But don’t buy internet BS rumors from hoaxsters. I own Parler.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, who owns Parler?</h2><p>Per Fortune, the company has not disclosed its ownership, but Dan announced in June 2020 that he had taken ownership stake. “I’ve decided it’s time to fight back against the tech tyrants,” he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said in a statement</a> at the time. “I’m beyond fed up with the censorship and bias of Twitter and Facebook and I’m not going to stand back and watch as they target us.”</p><p>Dan is a conservative commentator, former NYPD officer, and former Secret Service agent who made unsuccessful bids for Congress in 2012, 2014, and 2016 as a Republican candidate.
