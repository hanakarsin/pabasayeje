But theater snacks are infamous for being unreasonably expensive, often costing more than the price of admission. Thankfully, at least one theater worker makes a large popcorn worth the exorbitant price.</p><p>In Corpus Christi, Texas, there's a movie theater employee working the concession stand who has boiled the act of filling popcorn buckets into an art form. He has been making the rounds on <a href=#>TikTok</a> and has even made appearances on talk shows for his unique craft.</p><p>Dubbed the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">popcorn guy</a>," this worker has captured the hearts of moviegoers everywhere.

His initial TikTok was full of special effects and a soundtrack that highlighted how impressed he was with the popcorn guy, but he followed up with an unfettered look at what the popcorn guy could really do.</p><p>The popcorn guy, identified as Jason Grosboll, put his distinctive skills on display.</p><p>In the follow-up TikTok, Jason can be seen spinning and twirling a large popcorn bucket with a theatrical flair. He swiftly scoops layers of popcorn one by one into the bucket, topping off each section with butter and shaking it rigorously yet delicately to ensure that every piece of popcorn has a bit of buttery goodness. As of this writing, the video has over 14 million replays and one million likes. People in the comments are all raving about how impressive Jason's skills are.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@oanderle href=#>@oanderle</a><p>Replying to @oanderle The original video of the Popcorn Guy with no special effects <a title=popcornguy href=#>#popcornguy</a> <a title=thepopcornguy href=#>#thepopcornguy</a> <a title=popcorn href=#>#popcorn</a> <a title=movie href=#>#movie</a> <a title=oanderle href=#>#oanderle</a> <a title=movie href=#>#movie</a> <a title=avatar2 href=#>#avatar2</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=original href=#>#original</a> <a title=popular href=#>#popular</a> <a title=ReasonForBooking href=#>#ReasonForBooking</a> <a title=myhero href=#>#myhero</a> <a title=notallheroswearcapes href=#>#notallheroswearcapes</a> <a title=butter href=#>#butter</a> <a title=butterlovers href=#>#butterlovers</a> <a title=cinemark href=#>#Cinemark</a> <a title=rawfootage href=#>#rawfootage</a> <a title=rawvideo href=#>#rawvideo</a> <a title=noeffects href=#>#noeffects</a> <a title=nofilters href=#>#nofilters</a> <a title=unstoppable href=#>#unstoppable</a> <a title=epic href=#>#epic</a> <a title=butterbae href=#>#butterbae</a> <a title=butterking href=#>#butterking</a> <a title=buttergod href=#>#buttergod</a> <a title=popcornking href=#>#popcornking</a> <a title=butteryesplease href=#>#butteryesplease</a> <a title=bluelovebutterflies href=#>#bluelovebutterflies</a> <a title=dankvisionz href=#>#dankvisionz</a> <a title=perspective href=#>#perspective</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ Unstoppable (I put my armor on, show you how strong I am) - Sia" href=#>‚ô¨ Unstoppable (I put my armor on, show you how strong I am) - Sia</a></figure><p>Days after he achieved TikTok popularity, Jason started up his own account.
