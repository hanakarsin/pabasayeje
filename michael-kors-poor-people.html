Lodi, NJ isn't the most affluent town in Bergen County, which might be why the kids I went to school with were so concerned with the material possessions everyone else had.</p><p>Name labels and brands ruled the roost and everyone was so quick to point to their latest outfits as a means of distinguishing themselves. It always bothered me, not just because my family went through some rough financial times, but because it didn't seem like something anyone should be proud of to begin with. Call me corny, but shouldn't you value intelligence, good-heartedness, enthusiasm, work ethic, and a self-cultivation of talent over what your parents are able to afford? Just thinking about it makes me mad.</p><p>I got flashes of that "flex-rage" when <a href=#>Airpod memes started popping up all over Twitter</a>; it's sad to see that some things never change.</p><p>There's a group of bourgeois folks on Twitter who are outing Michael Kors as not being "premium enough" and are roasting anyone who likes the MK label.</p><p>Spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on a handbag seems like a moronic purchase to me regardless of the label on it, unless it possesses some crazy technology inside. But apparently some pieces of sewn-together and dried dead-cow skin are superior to others.</p><p>It all started with this tweet from @kyslime.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>He snapped a photo of a funky looking MK bag and urged folks on Twitter to "treat" their girls. But there was a sizable demographic that didn't think that bag constituted as a "treat" at all. There were some pretty harsh words for Michael Kors as a brand and those who like rocking their gear.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=ht dir=ltr><a href=#>@francobertogg</a> michael kors... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/s7ULZFwYVB</a></p>‚Äî pas (@pasqvs) <a href=#>June 21, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>It seems as though MK isn't really viewed as being "high end" by folks due to their over-saturation in the market. One Twitter user explained that because the company bifurcated its product line and started offering up "cheaper" alternatives that their designs aren't associated with other "premium" label offerings.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What killed Michael Kors was over saturation and the cheaper Michael Michael Kors line. It became a national anthem, all over Ross, Marshall‚Äôs and TJ Max. But notice how Tory Burch has managed to stay afloat while being in the same range. Plus those MKMKMKMK designs ü§£ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aTApAKnkos</a></p>‚Äî Alalipopp (@alalipopp) <a href=#>June 21, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: twitter</span></figure><p>There were some who rejected this line of thinking by pointing out simply that it's pretty darn silly to roast someone for liking a product, even if it isn't considered a "rich" brand. Personally, I can't think of a more miserable existence than judging everything you're going to wear and buy based on whether or not others will think of you as "rich" or not. Hard pass.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt fw Michael Kors but rockin fake Louis and Gucci? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JDtM3RagZ1</a></p>‚Äî B ‚ú® (@iamplava) <a href=#>June 21, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>y‚Äôall really out here thinking y‚Äôall got kylie jenner‚Äôs bank account or some shit talking about ‚Äúmichael kors too cheap‚Äù but y‚Äôall be adding promo codes to your online purchase, humble yourselves <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/eqg2AihSGc</a></p>‚Äî karolyna ‚ô° (@whoiskarolyna) <a href=#>June 21, 2019</a></figure><p>Others said that MK detractors are just a bunch of folks pretending to be big ballers while they're really just a bunch of nerds trying to flex for strangers.</p><p>Some even went so far as to offer to take any Michael Kors bags people don't want off of their hands since they think they're so "low class."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me on my way to take y‚Äôalls Michael Kors bags for myself since people want to be childish <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/J06jliKjbQ</a></p>‚Äî emy SDCC (@emythee) <a href=#>June 21, 2019</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>me grabbing my $300 Michael Kors bag that y‚Äôall think you‚Äôre too rich for <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6AplKIrG8y</a></p>‚Äî amber (@ambersrauhl) <a href=#>June 21, 2019</a></figure><p>Folks who blasted MK has being a "poor brand" also didn't really have anything to say about the company's designs or why they didn't like the designer, other than the fact that it has "poor" connotations.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm 100% serious. If Michael Kors is now for "poor people", please donate your unwanted Michael Kors goods to me. I am poor people and I will GLADLY take them off your hands. I'll DM the mailing address.

Are the designs gaudy? Yes. But if you're the kind of person who goes gaga over designer labels, then you're probably a big-time Versace lover.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforaktMCeo2ajn6fAbrzOqKlmqJWkva2x</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
