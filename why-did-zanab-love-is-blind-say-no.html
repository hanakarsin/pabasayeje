She makes it all the way to the altar on her wedding day, only to come loaded with a wedding speech that honestly speaks volumes.</p><p>But in case some viewers are confused as to why Zanab says no on Love Is Blind, she tells Cole exactly what she's feeling before she tells him she can't marry him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, why did Zanab say no on 'Love is Blind'?</h2><p>There's a long list of reasons why Zanab tells Cole no on their wedding day. Although the couple shares some common ground, like religion, there is far more that comes between them in the weeks leading up to their wedding. And for Zanab, a lot of that includes breaking down her self-confidence and self-worth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>"You have disrespected me, you have insulted me, you have critiqued me, and for what it is worth, you have single-handedly shattered my self-confidence," Zanab tells a speechless Cole. She adds, "The messed up thing is that I know I love you, but everything in me and the logical part of my brain tells me that love shouldn't feel this way. Love shouldn't hurt like this. I can't marry you."</p><p>When she walks back down the aisle, very much not married, she does so to the applause of some of hers and Cole's wedding guests. And it's clear that she feels she made the right decision.</p><p>Viewers watched Cole compare Zanab to his other pod crush, Colleen, multiple times throughout the season. They also saw how he made light of Zanab's concerns in their relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>In many ways, Cole and Zanab were doomed from the start. But it took until the day of their <a href=#>wedding</a> for Zanab to be truly ready to tell Cole that they aren't a great fit. And that they're both much better off without each other.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Fans applaud Zanab for her wedding speech on 'Love Is Blind.'</h2><p>Zanab and Cole's wedding guests aren't the only ones applauding Zanab's soon-to-be infamous wedding speech on Love Is Blind. As soon as viewers watched the finale on Netflix, many took to Twitter to cheer her on for being so candid and willing to stand up for herself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zanab Jaffrey (@zanabjaffrey)</a></p></figure><p>One fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, "Cole consistently disrespected Zanab throughout the entire season.
