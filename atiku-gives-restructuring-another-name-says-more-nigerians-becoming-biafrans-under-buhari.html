Developed segments will spur development in other segments because what they do well will attract the attention of others.&nbsp; That may make a Nigerian union more attractive and nation-building easier.&nbsp; Our poor nation-building record should not be an excuse for developmental inaction or backwardness.</p><p>“There is nothing in the current state of our nation-building that prevents Adamawa, Kano, Lagos or Rivers States from enumerating the number of existing and prospective primary and secondary school students and properly planning educational development in their respective states for the next five or ten years: – classroom blocks to be built, teachers to be hired and/or trained, textbooks to acquire, salaries to be paid, university spaces that would be required in the years to come, and so on.&nbsp; The same goes for roads and bridges, hospitals, and water supply.&nbsp; If they do these well wouldn’t Taraba and Benue States copy them? If they do them well wouldn’t Anambra and Kogi States emulate them?”</p><p>&nbsp;“It is obvious that a country is not necessarily a nation. Nationhood has to be forged through what we do as a country, and leadership is critical in the process of nation-building.&nbsp; Leaders give direction and the example they set determines the extent to which their followers will trust them. Without trust, there’s no leadership. Without leadership, a country drifts and becomes more difficult to forge into a nation,” the former Vice President said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5ByZpqsmaDCbrPIr5ysZaKawLW%2B1JyrrqqZo7Rurc2oq6GdomK7ornEZqqasaNiurC%2BxGalop%2BVp7aiutJmmZ6bn6K2r7OMm6CanqKWu7R51Kebnqpdl8KprdGiZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
