"So I hope that room right there is something that [guests] ... feel at home and because that's also where we do all the hanging out."</p><p>Feeling inspired by the HomeGoods digital experience, Tyler is going to use the tool for the most recent property he purchased in his hometown of Jupiter, Fla., which he plans to rent out as an Airbnb.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I just bought a house.

"I'm gonna plug in my dream for this house and it's going to help me get my inspiration for how I'm gonna design it and everything like that."</p><p>He continued, "I'm gonna turn one into an Airbnb so I can have people come to Jupiter, come experience what I've experienced in Jupiter. I'm gonna have a whole list of things for them to do, you know, kind of make a little vacation home for people to come visit. It's got a pool, it's a beautiful place."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>With Tyler's television past and his passion for building and flipping houses, is it possible that fans might see the reality star on a home renovation show?

Though he was not crowned the winner, the influencer told us that if another dancing show came knocking at his door — like Dancing With the Stars — he wouldn't pass up the opportunity.</p><p>"I love to dance. I'm always down to dance," he told us. "So if there's another dancing show, I'm in."</p><p>Though Tyler made his reality television debut on Hannah Brown's season of The Bachelorette, the reportedly single star will not be attending any rose ceremonies anytime in the near future... or ever again.</p><p>He previously stated that he would never appear on a Bachelor spinoff series, such as Paradise, and his stance on the matter has not changed.</p><p>"I live in paradise.
