Her ex, Dean Unglert, thinks she has what it takes to win.</h2><p>The 31-year-old, who celebrated her birthday just a day before the Season 26 premiere, is one of the women competing for Clayton's heart on The Bachelor. The two have a few major things in common.</p><p>While Clayton has been working as a medical sales representative since his brief stint in the NFL ended, Gabby is currently an ICU nurse. Before Gabby embarked on a career in healthcare, she was actually a cheerleader for the Denver Broncos.</p><p>In addition to their ties to professional football, both Gabby and Clayton are big dog people. The two share photos of their pups on their respective Instagram feeds — and Gabby noted in her Bachelor bio that it's a "nonnegotiable" for her future husband to love her goldendoodle, Leonardo.</p><p>According to that bio, Gabby is also looking for a man with "quiet confidence" — which means that Clayton could be her perfect match.</p><p>Prior to her time on The Bachelor, Gabby briefly dated Blake Horstmann. Becca Kufrin's runner-up shared in an episode of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Behind the Rose</a> podcast that he met the Season 26 star through one of his friends, who happened to be Gabby's former college roommate.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Their romance, which lasted for a "couple [of] months" happened years before Blake went on The Bachelorette.

She was my girlfriend from college," Dean said on his podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Help! I Suck at Dating</a>, before sharing that he spoke with production about whether his ex would be a good fit for the show.</p><p>"Producers called me and were like, 'Hey, we're thinking of casting this person — what do you think of her? We know that you dated 10 years ago.' And I was like, 'Oh, she's great. If she gets selected for the show, she'll either win the show or she'll be the next Bachelorette,'" he continued.

(SPOILERS)</h2><p>While viewers will have to tune in for direct confirmation about Gabby's journey on The Bachelor, there are a few unconfirmed spoilers about her time on the show.</p><p>According to the spoiler site <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a>, Gabby is an early standout for Clayton, and she secures a rose during one of the first group dates. The ICU nurse is rumored to make it to the final three, which means that viewers will get to see Clayton head to Denver for her hometown date.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>It's unclear at this time if Gabby makes it beyond the Fantasy Suite overnight dates.
