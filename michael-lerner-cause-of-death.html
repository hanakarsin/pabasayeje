Later, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, Michael's brother Ken Lerner revealed that Michael died from complications relating to brain seizures the actor had months prior to his death. Michael's nephew Sam Lerner shared the tragic news of his passing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> on April 9 and noted how missed his uncle already is.</p><p>"Everyone that knows him knows how insane he was — in the best way," Sam wrote on Instagram, under a collection of photos of the late actor.
