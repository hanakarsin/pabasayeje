It is a perfect example of a well-produced show, the crème de la crème of reality television shows in America.</p><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reality-competition</a> show has been airing on CBS for 40 seasons and 20 years. Mark Burnett produces it.</p><p class=align-left>Mark, alongside partner Charlie Parsons, spent four years peddling the concept before getting a buyer. The producer claims that the television show isn't reality but unscripted drama.</p><p class=align-left>When Burnett shared the series’ rough footage with the press, CBS frowned on him, telling him that he cannot do that. However, the stunned reaction from reporters changed their minds.</p><p class=align-left>People got a glimpse of contestants residing on an island as they competed for the ultimate prize and got them interested. And that is how Burnett realized that he had created something impeccable.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b77049bcccd40ab8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Squid Game: Top Trending Series Rejected for 10 Years before Making Netflix Splash</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">contestants</a> compete in different challenges to win rewards and immunity from being voted out of the competition by fellow participants.</p><p class=align-left>Ordinarily, the voting happens at the Tribunal Council ceremony. After a participant is voted off, the host informs them that the tribe has spoken and asks them to extinguish their torch. If one survives these voting sessions, then they win the final prize.</p><p class=align-left><i>Survivor</i> has stayed in production for two decades because of the producer's unique approach. Burnett emphasizes maintaining a steady format without adding numerous crazy twists or confusing rules.</p><h2>How much does Survivor pay per episode?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/544bad48a42792ec.jpeg><p class=align-left>Although everyone at <i>Survivor</i> wants the same thing, to win, there is only one winner that goes away with the prize. The stakes are even higher for the season 40 winner as the <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">reward stands at $2 million</a>. However, winning the game isn't the only way of making money. The contestants get remuneration for appearing on the show.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7d408cdf089310d8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars?

For example, the runner-up in season one went home with a check of $100,000.</p><p class=align-left>Do losers on <i>Survivor</i> get paid? Many people have been wondering whether losers get compensated in reality TV shows. You have to keep in mind that the longer one stays, the higher the remuneration.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, Ninja, the first tribe member ever to be voted off the island, got a check of only $2,500, and Rudy, who came in third, was paid $85,000 for the first season.</p><p class=align-left>Also, John Lewis, who was the ninth person voted out of the show, earned $27,500. Sue, who took fourth place, earned $70,000, while third-place Rudy Boesch went home with a check of $85,000.</p><p class=align-left>The reality TV show has been running for 20 years, and in that period, a lot has changed. For instance, three contestants are left at its end. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a>, anyone in the second and third positions received $110,000 each.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/44a0451294b26681.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How much money do Ink Master contestants get paid?

But, according to Fortune, the salary has increased over time.</p><p class=align-left>The updates have seen the first individual booted out of the reality TV show earning $3,500, while the runners-up make $110,000.</p><p class=align-left>Another interesting thing about the reality TV show is a standard check of $10,000 for appearing in the live finale where the winner is announced.</p><h3>Returning players earn a higher amount</h3><p class=align-left>Did you know that repeat contestants earn more money in the television show? For example, in the first all-star season in 2004, Tina Wesson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">earned $25,000</a>, and she was voted out first.

Unfortunately, Richard learned the hard way as he ended up spending <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">51 months in prison</a> for failing to pay taxes on his <i>Survivor</i> winnings and other earnings.</p><p class=align-left>If you do the math, one will end up with around $580,000 after taxes if they have won $1,000,000. The tax deduction means that nearly half of one's prize money goes away.

If you do a <i>Survivor</i> prize money breakdown after deducting taxes, you will realize that for one to stay on the prize money for 20 years, they'll have to budget less than $30,000 a year after taxes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2b12e63f222041df.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Maine Cabin Masters cast net worth and salary per episode</span></p></a><h2>Do Survivor jury members get paid?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b77049bcccd40ab8.jpeg><p class=align-left>The rest of <i>Survivor'</i>s castaways get something from the show even if they don't get the ultimate prize.
