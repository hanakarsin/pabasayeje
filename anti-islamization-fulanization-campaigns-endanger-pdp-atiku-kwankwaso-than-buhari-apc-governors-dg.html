Ortom of Benue whose constitutional powers to mobilise responses towards resolving challenges no matter how small, as enshrined in the amended 1999 Constitution has become a leading campaigner against what he considers Fulanisation and Islamisation agenda.</p><p>“As far as Ortom is concerned anybody arguing differently must be a supporter of Fulanisation and Islamisation agenda in the country.</p><p>“Which according to him is the continuation of the early 19th Century Fulani Jihad of Usman Danfodio,” he said.</p><p>The Progressive Governors’ DG then declared, “In the circumstance, as things are today, the so-called campaign against Fulanisation and Islamisation is more a danger to Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) than it is to APC.</p><p>“In fact, it more a danger to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, Gov. Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, and former Gov. Sule Lamido than it is a danger to Buhari or any potential APC Presidential candidate from the North,” he said.</p><p>He argued that it was also potentially a danger against the emergence of any possible presidential candidate in PDP from the South-West, South-East or South-South than it is to Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo among others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e49qZpqmpJ56qr%2FLmqSispGptrC6jJ%2BspZmenseiwMiopWabkaK9orXGp6pmnZ6Zrq%2BzxKtkqZygYq61tcquZKSvkaO4uK3SqGStoJGjeqPBx5qpomWRpbBus86vnKumn6fAbrDGaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
