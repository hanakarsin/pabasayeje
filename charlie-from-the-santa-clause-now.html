Keep reading for everything you need to know about Eric's life, career, and whether or not he'll reprise his role as Charlie in <a href=#>The Santa Clauses</a> on <a href=#>Disney Plus</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Eric Lloyd, who played Charlie Calvin in 'The Santa Clause,' now?</h2><p style=text-align:start>Although Eric's arguably most famous role is Charlie Calvin in 1994's The Santa Clause (and its sequels), he was also a child actor who appeared in many popular films and television shows of the late 1990s. He would go on to star in 1996's Dunston Checks In and even played a young Bruce Wayne in 1997's Batman & Robin.</p><p>After a career as a child actor, Eric seemingly disappeared from Hollywood, taking on occasional roles throughout the mid-2010s. However, in 2015, he opened <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Lloyd Production Studios</a>, a production and post-production film space in Glendale, Calif. Construction on the studio finally concluded in 2021. In Eric's <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram bio</a>, he identifies as an audio engineer and studio builder, and his Instagram is filled with photos of his handiwork.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Eric Lloyd (@ericlloydmorelli)</a></p></figure><p>Eric isn't the only one who works in the studio — in fact, his long-term partner, <a href=# style=text-align:start rel="noopener noreferrer">Cam</a>, is a mixed-media artist who has an art studio in the office! When the duo isn't posting adorable, relationship-goals-type photos together, they're working on individual projects. Eric is also a vocalist and guitarist in the band Radiomason, so Lloyd Productions Studio is never empty.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Charlie in 'The Santa Clauses' Disney Plus series?</h2><p>Disney fans will also be delighted to know that amid all his projects, Eric will return to the small screen as Charlie Calvin in the upcoming Disney Plus miniseries <a href=#>The Santa Clauses</a>! Fans were delighted that his original role hadn't been recast in this new, six-episode series as the Calvin family navigates Scott's pending retirement from the role of Santa Claus.</p><p>Congratulations to Eric on all his success. The Santa Clauses begins streaming exclusively on Disney Plus on Nov. 16, 2022, with new episodes airing every Wednesday until Dec. 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLWivsuinGaeoqS6bsDHnmSsmZ6prm6vy5qsrJ1do7y4</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
