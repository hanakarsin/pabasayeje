A <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> making the rounds online shows Shelly-Ann and some of her teammates (as well as American runner <a href=#>Sha'Carri Richardson</a>) standing behind a gate, being denied entry to the warm-up area. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">another video</a>, Shelly can be seen saying that she was unaware of the apparent rule change about who can use the gate, and that she'd used that same gate to enter the warm-up area the previous day.</p><p>Some people on social media speculated that perhaps this incident contributed to why Shelly wasn't at the race, but Jamaica's chef de mission Ian Kelly told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a> that while Shelly was slightly delayed because of the mix-up at the gate, this had nothing to do with why she didn't compete that night. Rather, he said, Shelly had sustained an injury while warming up.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Watch The Moment Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce Got Rejected Not To Enter Warm Up Area ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²<a href=#>#trackandfield</a> <a href=#>#Paris2024</a> <a href=#>#Olympics</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/6CiWf8FUuF</a></p>â€” Track Gossip ðŸ“Œ (@iceskidect) <a href=#>August 3, 2024</a></figure><p>"Mrs. Fraser-Pryce was allowed to enter the warm-up track but from another gate from which she was directed to enter from," he explained to Reuters. "There is no truth that she was not allowed to enter the stadium. Unfortunately she was not able to compete due to an injury sustained during her final warm-up."</p><p>But some social media users think there may have been more to the story, and that perhaps the delay did actually contribute to why Shelly didn't race. "By the time they got in [she] had too little time to warm up which led to an injury," one person speculated on Instagram under <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shelly's post</a> about the incident. Shelly's post didn't go into detail about what happened, but rather she wrote about her "disappointment" and her "immense gratitude."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What fresh level of madness is this?
