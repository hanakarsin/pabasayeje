Fans of the 90 Day Fiancé franchise watched Ashley and Manuel's story unfold for the first time during Season 10 of the flagship series. They then welcomed the couple back immediately after the season ended with Season 8 of 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They then welcomed the couple back immediately after the season ended with Season 8 of <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?</a>, but Ashley and Manuel could be back on the screen because there's still some drama that has yet to be fully hashed out. Like, perhaps, with Manuel's kids.</p><p>Manuel's family in general is a topic of conversation and a point of contention between Manuel and Ashley on the show. He left behind his extended family and his children to move to the United States to marry Ashley and be with her long-term. But since he left his kids back in Ecuador and has yet to share any plans to send for them, Ashley and her family are a little concerned.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@jesusnegritovelezrojas</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How many kids does Manuel have on '90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After?' Season 8?</h2><p>Unlike some of the couples in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise, Ashley and Manuel met in a more organic way than a dating app. 10 years before they became part of the wild journey on the reality show, Ashley met Manuel at a party when she briefly moved to Ecuador to study abroad. It explains why she is so fluent in the language and why a language barrier is the one issue these two don't have. Again, that's rare for a 90 Day Fiancé couple.</p><p>But now that they're married, Ashley is more determined than ever to have Manuel integrate his family with hers, and that includes his kids. Manuel has two kids from a previous relationship. They're both boys and they're 12 and 14 years old. Possibly because of their young ages, Manuel didn't share many more details, or even video calls or photos of his sons, on 90 Day Fiancé.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jesus Negrito Velez Rojas (@jesusnegritovelezrojas)</a></p></figure><p>But now, because Manuel remains so guarded when it comes to his kids, Ashley and her family are worried about what Manuel might be keeping from his new bride. Ashley's mom even says in the Season 8 premiere, "what if it's more than two kids?" in reference to how many kids Manuel actually has. There is a young girl featured in some Instagram posts on Manuel's account, but every time someone comments to ask if she's his daughter, Manuel doesn't respond.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Has Ashley met Manuel's kids?</h2><p>Although Ashley and Manuel got married on 90 Day Fiancé and they're still together on Happily Ever After, she hasn't yet met his sons, who are now her step-children. The details of Manuel's relationship with his kids' mother is also something of a mystery, and you can't really blame Ashley or her family for being extremely curious about it all.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@ashleymichelle_90day</a></figure><p>For the most part, Manuel seems like a dedicated dad who wants to provide for his kids. He was adamant about sending money back home to his family prior to his and Ashley's wedding. But it's still not clear what the plan is for Manuel's kids, and if he expects them to eventually move to the U.S. too.</p><p>Watch 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? on Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq6vwcSlZKShlKh6enyMnZiyZZaerq%2BvxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
