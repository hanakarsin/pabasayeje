Not only is the title of the reality competition’s 35th season (which premieres on April 1) fitting during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the show also provides a welcome respite from the anxieties crowding our psyche during these uncertain times.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in October, we found out <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the location</a> for Total Madness, and according to one veteran contestant, it's the most brutal living situation he’s ever experienced on the series.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What location did MTV choose for 'The Challenge: Total Madness'?</h2><p>This season takes place in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, and pits 21 former Challenge competitors against seven rookies. Unlike previous installments, the players won’t be split into teams. Instead, it will be every man for himself.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: MTV</span></figure><p>What made Total Madness particularly rough was the real Cold War bunker contestants stayed in throughout the game’s duration. "You’re underground in Prague in the dead of winter, so it’s already cold and with no windows," <a href=#>Johnny "Bananas" Devenanzio</a> — who’s competed in a total of 20 Challenges — told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Insider</a>.</p><p>"Normally you go on and you’re living in this amazing villa or mansion in Thailand or somewhere tropical," he continued. "We were living in a bunker that was created for war. It’s a Soviet, Cold War, anti-aircraft bunker where they actually launched missiles at American spy planes."</p><p>Johnny confessed that he typically views the players’ lodgings as a retreat from the pressures of competition, but that wasn’t the case this time around. "It was almost like you’re looking forward to doing challenges rather than sitting in this bunker withering away and being left to your own devices. It was pretty gnarly," he explained.</p><p>Despite being confined to a subterranean edifice for long periods of time, Johnny admitted that nothing could have prepared him for the level of isolation brought on by the recent spread of coronavirus. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"This is unlike anything anyone has had to go through," he noted. "Even for me, someone who has essentially been forced to be quarantined inside houses and bunkers and beaches. This is different."</p><p>The 37-year-old added that it feels "eerily serendipitous" to have lived in a wartime bunker just a few months before many countries issued shelter-in-place orders.&nbsp;</p><p>"I do hope this upcoming season is going to be a momentary escape for people where they can watch it and step away from their madness and live in our madness for a little bit," he expressed.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is in the cast of 'The Challenge: Total Madness'?</h2><p>Most of this season’s competitors are Challenge alums like Johnny.
