It showed Masika in her underwear, covered in bruises and other bodily injuries. She told fans she'd been kidnapped and needed money, plugging her <a href=#>OnlyFans account</a> "I've been kidnapped. I'm in a warehouse somewhere. Idk where! I'm so scared! They took all my money and they want more! Please! Help me! Subscribe to my only fans and tip me. They're coming!!!!" she said. Except people were quick to point out something felt fishy about the video.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>what is this‚ù§Ô∏è <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RphFG8sLPC</a></p>‚Äî leon (@Leon_L_LL) <a href=#>August 26, 2020</a></figure><p>Masika deleted the video from Instagram and uploaded a new one an hour ago ‚Äî posting it to the platform as well as Twitter ‚Äî in which she explained she was just filming for her new show and that the bruises were only makeup. She claimed that she scared people on purpose so that they'd pay more attention, and told followers to support the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">R.O.S.E. Organization</a>, a non-profit that brings awareness to sex trafficking, homelessness, and drug addiction. She also initially links to the wrong R.O.S.E. Organization Instagram account in her caption (it's the second link, FYI).&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Please follow @r.o.s.e._organization now for more info on how to put an end to child and human sex trafficking.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Masika Kalysha</a> (@masikakalysha) on Aug 25, 2020 at 4:33pm PDT</p></figure><p>People are rightfully upset, calling her out for exploitation and using real victim and survivor experiences for her own personal gain. Nobody is buying that the reality star posted the video of herself getting "kidnapped" to spread awareness about R.O.S.E. If that were the case, why delete the video, and why ask people to subscribe and tip on OnlyFans?&nbsp;</p><p>"What u did was wrong af," one Instagram user wrote in the comments. Another wrote, "You have minimized REAL VICTIMS experiences. 'Now that I have your attention' it was for your only fans. Smh I really hope they cancel you and I don‚Äôt even like cancel culture." Others are demanding an apology. "Girl this ain‚Äôt no damn apology.. sorry if you scared us? That shit was beyond pathetic and trashy. You need to apologize to real victims out here," one person tweeted.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Girl this ain‚Äôt no damn apology.. sorry if you scared us?

Things like this live on the internet forever, so she really does have some explaining to do. It's true that we all fall on hard times, but to appropriate the experiences of those who have been assaulted in abused in real life is just not okay.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you need support, The National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24/7 at&nbsp;1-800-656-4673.
