I don't have kids, but my gut tells me that raising a kid is one the hardest things you could do. Trying to take care of someone who doesn't always respond to reason or logic day after day seems exhausting. I understand it when parents screw up.
That being said, I do think there are things a parent could do that go way over the line."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I'm a dancer and used to compete on teams and as a soloist. (I don't compete anymore, college probs) One day, I was competing my solo and just touching up my make up in the dressing room where I accidentally was in the way of a mom and her daughter who was my age. I said "Sorry, I'll be out of your way in a sec." and the mom says I'm totally fine and something about sharing a bathroom with siblings. I laugh and say "Oh yeah, I get you, I have three younger siblings myself." and the mom says "Really? I would've stopped after you!" Right in front of her kid. I smiled uncomfortably, grabbed my bag and moved to the other side of the room.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>LumosErin</strong></a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">No one cares about your feelings!</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>ostentia's comment from discussion "What is the most disturbing thing you have ever overheard a parent tell their own child in a public setting?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Well, as long as he is happy.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>squid1891's comment from discussion "What is the most disturbing thing you have ever overheard a parent tell their own child in a public setting?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">And we wonder why racism still exists.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>rudeboi95's comment from discussion "What is the most disturbing thing you have ever overheard a parent tell their own child in a public setting?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So disturbing.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>rudeboi95's comment from discussion "What is the most disturbing thing you have ever overheard a parent tell their own child in a public setting?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How is every word in this sentence the worst possible word?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>SlaveNumber23's comment from discussion "What is the most disturbing thing you have ever overheard a parent tell their own child in a public setting?"</a>.</figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">He didn't.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Exaggeration17A's comment from discussion "What is the most disturbing thing you have ever overheard a parent tell their own child in a public setting?"</a>.</figure><p>Let's all try to do better, shall we?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><h2>More from Distractify&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=#><u>30-Year-Old Evicted from His Parents’ House Gives the Cringiest Interview Ever</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>These Shameless Girls Bragged About Stealing a Tip Jar — But the Internet Tracked Them Down</u></a></p><p><a href=#><u>This Girl Found out Her Boyfriend Was Cheating from a Jimmy Johns Delivery Guy</u></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKqVoa61tc6nqqGhoKh8c3yQcGZpbF9lgnCv126eameUnsC1wdGboKefXamyrbiMpKCdqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
