Look at the frontline politicians. If you talk about the PDP, people can predict Atiku or Wike. When it comes to the APC, we really don’t know.</p><p>“It is like we are banking on the fake vote bank of the President. This doesn’t exist again. But they still think they can just carry Buhari’s signature to win. This can’t work.</p><p>“There are lots of speculations about former President Goodluck Jonathan and certain agenda. Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has invested more. He has moved around and got lots of support from the delegates. Whether they want to disenfranchise this huge democratic investment or not, we don’t know. Perhaps, they are trying to have a forced consensus. And once they do that, they are disenfranchising their major actors. That’s why we who believe in democracy and the future don’t believe that’s our domain. We need to be very strategic in our thinking.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FqZmtoYmh6o8HHmqmiq12otqi6wK2sq51dmK6vec2oZKWnnpyys3nWoqVmnZyasLW1zqeqZp%2BRp6%2Biew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
