The campaign was developed to boost foreign exchange earnings through the non-oil export sector while preparing Nigeria for an economy that would not be dependent on crude oil export for its survival.”</p><p class=p1>He said the NEPC was partnering with the National Orientation Agency (NOA) to carry the campaign to the grassroots, noting that as a critical stakeholder, chairmen of States Committee on Export Promotion (SCEP) were expected to join hands in propagating the campaign in their respective domains.</p><p class=p1>According to Yakusak, through the partnership of NEPC with SCEP, the nation had witnessed a sharp increase in the number of NEPC offices from 15 in 2016 to 34.</p><p class=p1>“We are strongly hoping that Bayelsa and Yobe States would soon come on board to have full national coverage,” he noted.</p><p class=p1>“Regrettably, however, as important as the SCEP is to non-oil export development in the country, the potential of this important committee is not being fully utilized. It is on this note that we convened this forum to discuss identified challenges bedeviling SCEP operations in each State and to jointly proffer workable solutions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49tZqennmK8qriMnq%2Bpp6KpwG6z0aiuraBdpcK0tMSsZKedoJh6tbuMnJilpF2bvLN50q6nqaeiqXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
