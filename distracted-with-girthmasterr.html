It wasn’t long before <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Girthmasterr</a>, not to mention his, um, ripe eggplant, was Twitter’s favorite topic. (For those curious, he’s got a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Doc Johnson replica toy</a> launching soon.)</p><p>The OF star’s physical similarities to Boogie Nights’ well-endowed protagonist Dirk Diggler are no secret. However, Girthmasterr is a more charming, grounded, and progressive version of Mark Wahlberg’s ‘70s porn star, even inspiring necessary conversations concerning outdated industry stigmas and the nuances of gender and modern sex work.</p><p>Distractify got intimate with Girthmasterr as he revealed his hottest hot take, dating preferences, dream collab, and more.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Talk about the best fan interaction you’ve ever had.</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> A fan bought me a beer once at a bar. [He said], "Love your work."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@girthmasterr</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What was the moment you felt like you had "made it"?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> There's been so many of them! Either when I shot with Angela White or when I got in Rolling Stone.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Shout out one of your favorite fellow creators!</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> Let me go with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kazumi</a>. She's like a marketing genius as far as porn goes. I took a lot of pages out of her book. She doesn't gatekeep any of the information she has — she speaks openly about her strategy, so I've literally watched her videos with a pencil and paper, taking notes on how to market myself.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Tell us about your dream collaboration.</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> It already happened twice now! It was always Angela White. I created my personal standards around working, like, "If I work with Angela White, how would I handle the situation?" ... My standards have always been based around working with Angela. I shot with her twice and I have another shoot coming up in a couple of days. Living my dream!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Girthmasterr</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What’s your favorite TV show?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> Let me say The Sopranos, Brooklyn Nine-Nine … Sex and the City as well, gotta throw that in there! … I have two older sisters, so I grew up — it’d be on the TV and I’d be like, "Ew, don’t watch this! I hate this!" And then I’d stand in the doorway [to watch].</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you had to get a tattoo right now, what would it be?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> I'm gonna get a matching tattoo with [a friend from back home.] We haven't decided what yet. … I've got a few already, but there's nothing I'm itching to get.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">If you couldn’t be a content creator, what would your dream job be?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> Honestly, the most fun jobs I've had are things like ... when I was a construction worker. The work isn’t fun, but the people are fun. That’s what really makes it. Yeah, a construction worker. That environment is really fun. Hangin’ with the fellas, goofing around.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@girthmasterr</span></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's the weirdest or funniest rumor you've heard about yourself?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> That I have d--k implants. There are forums dedicated to [speculating] which implants I got. I've never been able to afford implants. There are pictures of me online from when I was 18. I was, like, near homeless — I didn’t have money for implants!</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What's your hottest hot take?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> We need better, normal olive oil. Everything's extra virgin; what if I want to fry something in olive oil? Extra virgin smokes way too early. I go to the store and every single bottle is extra virgin. … It's not like it's better quality, they use the same olives! It's just a different process. Give me good quality normal olive oil, please. That's the only thing I'm heated about.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">You’ve previously spoken a bit about navigating your dating life. So, what does a first date with the Girthmasterr look like?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> Either coffee, or evening drinks at a bar somewhere, a nice view. That's the important part to me: a nice view, something like that. It'd be a couple casual drinks, maybe fries.</p><p>I'll tell them that I do marketing. And then after a couple of drinks, once we get to know each other a bit, if I like them, I'll tell them, ‘When I said marketing, I really mean I do OnlyFans.’ … lf it's the first thing they know about me, that's all they want to talk about. And I'd rather get to know each other some before that kind of dominates the conversation. … I only go on dates with cool people, and they're always fine about it. They're very interested. And as soon as I go to the bathroom, I'm sure they're hitting up the group chat.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by EDGE Media Network (@edgemedianetwork)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Tell us a fact about yourself that may surprise people.</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> I speak a bit of Spanish. I did three semesters of Spanish and I used to work with a bunch of Mexican guys when I did landscaping.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">Where do you see yourself in 10 years?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> On a warm sandy beach with a margarita in hand, hopefully. I don't really want for much. Once my mom's retired and I have my own house, own a roof over my head and the land under my feet — that's kind of more than I anticipated having in life. There'll be residuals coming in. I'll still be doing things here and there, but in 10 years, hopefully I have at least the option to chill on a beach with a margarita in hand.</p><h2 class="sc-leegwF dqAuUD">What’s your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>GM:</strong> TikTok! Doomscrolling on TikTok. It will keep me up for hours. … It's affected my attention span in other areas of my life. I was on a plane the other day, and I realized I had a movie going on the screen, I had a Gameboy in one hand, and my phone in the other. How can I not focus on one thing at a time?!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZp6iqqSduqK%2F056pqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
