Here's everything we know about Harrison's life with his wife.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Harrison Ford met now-wife Calista Flockhart in 2002.</h2><p>Prior to his marriage to Calista, Harrison was married two times before: first to Mary Marquardt and second to screenwriter Melissa Mathison. After Harrison and Melissa separated in 2001, Harrison began dating Calista, whom he met for the first time in 2002 at the Golden Globe Awards.</p><p>Actress Calista is best known for playing titular character Ally McBeal on the courtroom comedy-drama of the same name from 1997–2002. She then played Kitty Walker on Brothers & Sisters from 2006–2011.</p><p>At the time, the duo were familiar with each other's work, but Calista — who is 22 years younger than Harrison — said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> magazine, "I remember loving him in Mosquito Coast, but I didn't really think about him."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Harrison and Calista were married in 2009.</h2><p>The pair dated until 2009, when Harrison proposed over Valentine's Day weekend while the duo were on vacation with her son. They married on June 15, 2010, in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the Governor's Mansion. Their wedding location was chosen due to Harrison filming Cowboys & Aliens nearby and it was officiated by Governor Bill Richardson, under the supervision of New Mexico's chief justice, Charles W. Daniels.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Harrison and Calista share one child, a son named Liam.</h2><p>Calista adopted a son, Liam, in 2001, just before meeting Harrison. Harrison would later adopt Liam as his own, but said of Calista's parenting in 2008, "She's a mother by choice — she adopted Liam before we met, as a single parent, which is an awesome responsibility to take. She's devoted herself to Liam and has done a really wonderful job raising him. I'm happy to now have a part of the job," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reader's Digest</a>.</p><p>Harrison has a total of five children, with two sons from his marriage to Mary Marquardt and a son and a daughter from his marriage to Melissa Mathison.
