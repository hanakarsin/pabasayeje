Source: istockYotuber Shiey is a self-proclaimed urban explorer. He goes into off-limit areas of cities and records what he finds. He then uploads the videos to YouTube so we don't have to partake in his very illegal hobby. Legal or not, I would not want to venture into his most recent finding because it is the creepiest thing I have ever seen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Legal or not, I would not want to venture into his most recent finding because it is the creepiest thing I have ever seen.&nbsp;</p><p>While exploring an old factory in Russia, he made a startling discovery. In the description he explains,&nbsp;</p>Seemed abandoned, but it had electricity and ventilation, so...While walking through the territory of a factory, located in the industrial area of the city, I noticed a weird concrete block with a metal gate on the side of it. I opened it and a latter [sic] climb later I was in a dark, small tunnel leading to an underground bomb shelter/safe house.<figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>The background music was added into the post but even without it, that place may the spookiest spot in the world. A zombie never jumps out at Shiey, but you just know it could happen at any moment.&nbsp;</p><p>While everyone thinks this is a really cool find, everyone has follow up questions.&nbsp;</p>What's really weird about this is that there doesn't seem to be any food in this bunker, not even cans of food (unless I missed it?).Who creates a huge bunker and stocks with medical supplies and clothing but doesn't put any food in it?<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>redcoatwright</strong></a></p>Does he keep an air tester with him? Old sealed off underground air is a quick way to get dead.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>sl1mman</strong></a></p>I would have liked to see a bit more of all those signs and paper clippings/posters all over the place.A close up would have been perfect.<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CourtneyChaos</strong></a></p>So the only way in and out from this place is through that opening he went through? Couldn't he have been locked in from the outside?<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>jaroiten</strong></a></p><p>So, Mr. Sheiy, it seems like your fans want you to go back. My advice is don't. The zombie might get you next time.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Freaky, right?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKednHxzfJBwZmltX2WCcKahj6qob1%2BorqexjKGmrquVYrCzscSpsA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
