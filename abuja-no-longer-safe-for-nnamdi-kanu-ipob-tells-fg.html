The UN Group warned that if anything untoward happens to him it will be disastrous to Nigeria, and IPOB is ready to carry this order to the letter.</p><p>“We are advising the Fulani terrorists government of Nigeria to urgently release Mazi Nnamdi KANU unconditionally before their planned jihad in Abuja. We are monitoring them and the shenanigans they are playing with their terrorist collaborators to take over the government. IPOB is neither bothered nor interested in the plan of the terrorists to overrun the Nigerian government which we have rejected; our concern is the safety of our leader. We, therefore, demand that the Nigerian government must release the leader of IPOB now because he committed no crime as enunciated by the UN Right group.</p><p>“As Nigeria is closing schools, businesses, and other activities because of Fulani terrorists’ threat to attack Abuja, it clearly shows that Abuja is no longer safe for people to live. Hence our unequivocal demand for the unconditional release of Mazi Nnamdi KANU before anything happens to him. We demand prompt and complete implementation of the UN directives concerning Mazi Nnamdi Kanu.”</p><h2>Nigeria Must Release Kanu</h2><p>Earlier on Thursday, the special counsel to the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, <strong>Aloy Ejimakor</strong> warned the Nigerian government about <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the consequences</a></strong> of disobeying a United Nations (UN) order for his client’s release.</p><p>The lawyer in a statement made available to Naija News said Nigeria is bound to obey the UN order for the IPOB leader to be released.</p><p>He argued that if the Nigerian government fails to obey within six months as stipulated by the UN, a diplomatic row can be triggered which will definitely be against the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FxZpqapZ%2BubrrOZqOoppeav26%2FwJ%2BcZp6fp3qvusCmm6Jlm5a7tnnIqaabZaSaua2%2FjJ%2BeaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
