Ahmed Idris Wase and other leaders of the House had a meeting with the Head of Service of the Federation (HoS), Mrs Folashade Yemi-Esan, the chairman of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, Mr. Ekpo Nta, among other government officials.</h2><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports that ASUU has been on strike since February 14 to press home the demand for improved funding for universities, a review of salaries for lecturers, among other issues.</p><p>Several meetings between ASUU and the federal government have ended in a deadlock.</p><p>Consequently, the federal government went to court to challenge the strike.</p><p>Yesterday, the national industrial court of Nigeria (NICN) ordered the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to call off its ongoing nationwide strike.</p><p>However, ASUU has indicated that they will be appealing the court order.</p><p>Addressing the situation, the House of Representative leadership invited the Head of Service, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, the Accountant General of the Federation, among others.</p><p>At Thursday’s meeting, NITDA told the House leadership that the Integrated Payroll Personnel Information System (IPPIS), the University Transparency Accountability Solution (UTAS) and the University Peculiar Personnel and Payroll System (U3PS) failed its integrity tests regarding the university payroll, which the agency conducted between March and June this year.</p><p>A NITDA official at the meeting informed the House leadership that the government directed the agency to test UTAS in October, 2020, and that the platform failed the two integrity tests conducted on it.</p><p>He explained that after the test ASUU was told to go back and review, which it did. However, they did not meet NITDA’s requirements the second time.</p><p>For the third time, NITDA was then asked to conduct tests on UTAS, IPPIS and U3PS, which the official said all the three platforms failed its requirements regarding the payroll system of universities.</p><p>The explanation from NITDA did not sit well with Gbajabiamila and he asked if the body advised the government to take action on the lapses found on IPPIS, which has been in operation by government since 2011. But the NITDA official said they were not in a position to do that.</p><p>Gbajabiamila also asked if NITDA queried IPPIS platform, to which the official responded in the negative.</p><p>The Deputy Speaker Wase also expressed his disappointment at NITDA’s action, insisting that it ought to have advised government on the appropriate action to take in view of its discovery on IPPIS.</p><p>However, the Head of Service, in her explanation, said the ministry of communications and digital economy wrote her office following NITDA’s observations about IPPIS on the need to take a holistic look at the platform and that a committee was empaneled to carry out the assignment.</p><p>She also noted that IPPIS is not just a payment platform but that it also has a human resource component, which all government agencies have been directed to activate, noting that all those directly under her purview have since complied.</p><p>Also, the chairman of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission, Mr Nta, told the House leadership that in view of the general agitation in the tertiary education sector, the agency advised the government to look at the possibility of increasing the salaries of the staff in the entire sector, comprising universities, polytechnics and colleges of education.</p><p>He said, however, that at the end of the day, the government decided to increase the salaries of lecturers in the universities by a certain percentage, while professors were considered for higher percentage.</p><p>He said he was not aware of any agreement between the Federal Government and ASUU for salary increment.</p><p>Also speaking at the meeting, the acting Accountant General of the Federation, Mr. Sylva Okolieaboh, said under no circumstance should employees dictate to their employers how they should be paid, faulting ASUU’s insistence on UTAS.</p><p>After hours of deliberation Gbajabiamila suggested that further follow-up meeting with ASUU officials be held on Thursday next week, which the stakeholders subscribed to. The meeting was, therefore, adjourned to Thursday next week.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FrZpqrpap8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
