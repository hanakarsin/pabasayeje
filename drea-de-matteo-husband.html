It happened in Season 5 after Adriana had become an FBI informant. The title of the episode is “Long Term Parking” which both references where Adriana's car is left and the idea that the only commitment one can make in the mafia world, is to extending parking spots at the airport.</p><p>Unfortunately death came for Adriana after her fiance Christopher (<a href=#>Michael Imperioli</a>) chose his mafia family over her by revealing to them that she was a mole. Sadly their relationship was never good. Thankfully Drea de Matteo appears to have made much better choices in the real world, when it comes to love. Let's take a look at her law-abiding husband</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Drea de Matteo's husband?</h2><p>Drea is married to former All Them Witches drummer Robby Staebler who according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Obelisk</a>, left the band in April 2024. In an update sent to the group's Bandcamp followers, Robby said he was grateful to everyone who supported him and the band he helped start, but it was time to focus on other projects. He then linked to his Patreon and ULTRAFREE, a clothing company he started with Drea.</p><p>In a February 2024 interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Drea opened up about starting an OnlyFans account which she said literally saved her life. Not only did it allow the Sons of Anarchy actor to take care of her children and a sick parent as well as save her home from foreclosure, but she was able to start this clothing line that she says was inspired by her 12 year-old son Waylon.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Both she and Robby want the clothes they make to represent freedom in all its forms, whether it's from a "mental illness or physical illness or an ideology," she explained to the outlet. "The merch is all about ... don't let them tell you who you are, you already know who you are no matter what. Don't let anybody keep you small, you don't need a movement, you just need to be free."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Drea de Matteo was previously in relationships with two other musicians.</h2><p>In 2009 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE</a> reported that Drea received a proposal from then-boyfriend Shooter Jennings, the son of infamous country singer Waylon Jennings, at a concert in Utica, N.Y.. The couple had been dating since 2001 and shared a daughter who was 18 months old at the time. Two years later, Drea gave birth to their daughter, per Saving Country Music, but the couple split soon after.</p><p>Suddenly in July 2015, Whitesnake bass player Michael Devin was proposing to Drea on stage during one of their shows. Who says concert proposal engagement lightning can't strike twice? <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLEwh</a> reported that at a show in Atlantic City, Michael pulled the trigger during the band introductions. "I fell in love with a very beautiful woman a few years ago, and I want to embarrass her as much as I can," he said. As Drea walked out with her two children, he popped the question. Obviously it didn't last.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmb%2BmrYydnGalkanBpruMoaysmpGjsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
