It also has a repayment period of up to 60 months, and the interest charged is a one percent reducing balance.</p><h3>Top â€“ Up or Refinance Loan</h3><p class=align-left>This is another loan type that helps members with already existing loans to get more cash on loan. It works on all other loan types offered by Sacco, except the product loan. Members eligible for this type of loan must have paid the existing loan for at least six months. The interest rate charged is 1% reducing balance.</p><h3>Emergency loan</h3><p class=align-left>Like it is with most financial institutions, the emergency loan is a common type of product. Biblia offers it within 48 hours, and it should be rapid in a maximum of 24 months.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e839ada2eb2a3ea4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nyati Sacco loans: types, application requirements, forms, paybill number</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The interest rate is 1%, reducing balance every month. Members can only get up to 200,000 Kenya shillings as long as they attach required documents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/97d3ec51793b267b.jpeg><h3>Salary advance loan</h3><p class=align-left>This one works for members who pay their shares consistently and have a good loan repayment record. It operates under normal application terms, and advances are offered at a rate of half the amount of shares one owns.</p><p class=align-left>Members are expected to pay this loan within a month to three months. To get it, you need to provide a three months payment slip and three months bank statement details.</p><h3>Sinking fund loan</h3><p class=align-left>Normal terms apply in this case as long as members consistently contribute their shares and repay loans. The interest payable for this type of loan is 1.25% per month on a reducing balance rate.</p><p class=align-left>Members are eligible for up to 300,000 Kenya shillings to be repaid in 24 months. A member's loan ration must also be lower than 60% to qualify for this type of loan.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/30448a7d008116d0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mwalimu Sacco loans: Types, requirements, and interest rates</span></p></a><h3>Product loan</h3><p class=align-left>This is another popular loan type on Biblia Sacco. It is offered to members who want to buy household items, a car, or even land. The interest rate is a bit different as it is charged at 14% per annum. There is a year allowed for servicing the product.</p><h3>Insurance premium finance</h3><p class=align-left>The application is made under normal terms. However, members must contribute shares and pay their loans consistently. The marked repayment period is often 12 months at a 1.25% interest rate monthly, on reducing balance. The maximum amount of loan offered depends on the premium payable, and cheques are written directly to the insurance company of choice.</p><h3>Premium loan</h3><p class=align-left>This is a special kind of loan that is offered to members who pay their loans above the normal ceiling and at higher interest rates. You only apply after at least a year of surviving the development. Terms of application are also normal for all members interested in this type of loan.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6c471adc95b1c2df.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 car logbook loan providers in Kenya</span></p></a><h2>How to join Biblia Sacco</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e839ada2eb2a3ea4.jpeg><p class=align-left>To join this Sacco, one has to first meet certain basic requirements set by the organization.
