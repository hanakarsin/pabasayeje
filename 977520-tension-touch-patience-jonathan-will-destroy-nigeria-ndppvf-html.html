The group, according to an online news portal, TheCable, advised EFCC to lift the No Debit Order imposed on her Skye Bank accounts.</p><p>The accounts contain more than $15 million, but Jonathan’s wife has since explained that the money was meant for her medical bills.</p><p>Last week, the EFCC filed money laundering charges against Waripamowei Dudafa, Jonathan’s special adviser on domestic affairs, whom the former first lady directed to open the accounts Dudafa, Amajuoyi Briggs, a lawyer; and Damola Bolodeoku, a Skye Bank official.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>BREAKING: Minister of women affairs reacts to allegedly collapsing in Adamawa</p><p>On Tuesday, the Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, also told journalists that Jonathan’s wife was under investigation.</p><p>But in a statement by Parkinson George-Amabo, spokesman of NDPPVF, the group warned Magu that investigating Patience could result into “bad blood, embarrassment and possible unrest in the Niger Delta.”</p><p>The group said it is not in support of corruption, but against the manner in which the agency is investigating Patience who has had an “impressive and fortuitous pedigree.”</p><p><i>“As a matter of fact, the EFCC has launched a criminal investigation of Mrs. Jonathan and in the process, frozen her bank accounts domiciled with a Nigerian commercial bank without affording her opportunity to state her own side of the matter,” the statement read.</i></p><p><i>“Nobody is above the law. The NDPPVF does not support or condone corruption. If Mrs. Jonathan was found to be corrupt, we shall not hesitate to call for her prosecution.</i></p><p><i>“We, however, have a grouse with the modus operandi of Mrs. Jonathan’s investigation, given her status as the wife of a former deputy governor, former governor, former vice-president, former acting president and finally, former president. She is perhaps, the only Nigerian woman – dead or alive – with such an impressive and fortuitous pedigree; which accounts for why the EFCC needs to thread with caution.</i></p><p><i>“Recently, there have been calls on the Attorney-General of the Federation as well as the EFCC to arrest and prosecute the former First Lady for alleged money laundering.</i></p><p><i>“We shall simultaneously bomb the 4 wings of the NNPC Towers the day it is announced that Mrs. Patience Goodluck Jonathan has been arrestedThe group added that before her husband emerged as vice-president in 2007, the EFCC investigated Mrs. Jonathan and cleared of any wrongdoing.”</i></p><p>Meanwhile, Ibrahim Magu who is the chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has promised Patience Jonathan, that she would be investigated for the $15,591,700 she claimed belonged to her.</p><p>The anti-graft agency had placed restriction on the an account which the former first lady later claimed to be hers.</p><p>The Guardian reports that the account is being fingered as one of those involved in an alleged fraud case before a Federal High Court sitting in Lagos but Mrs Jonathan’s counsel, Gboyega Oduwole has filed a case before the court, informing that his client is unhappy with the EFCC over the recent move to freeze the account.</p><p>Amajuoyi Azubike Briggs, an ex-presidential aide; Damola Bolodeoku, a former Skye Bank official; Pluto Property and Investment Company Limited and Avalon Global Property Development Company Limited had all been charged to court over their individual involvement in the fraudulent activities with companies without address.</p><p>The EFCC has taken more tough moves against Patience Jonathan by freezing her personal account with the account name: titled ‘Patience Ibifaka Jonathan’. The former first lady has been under the radar of the anti-graft agency for financial-corruption allegation and had placed restrictions on account she claimed to be hers.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhniDlGtnZqyVo8Cqu81mq6itk516sa3Topynm5Vit7C6wK2fmqZdrLatuIydnKysoqTGbrrIoJyroZFiu6W8z6%2BdZ6Ckork%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
