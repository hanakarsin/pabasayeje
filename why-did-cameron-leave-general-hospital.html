He will be attending Stanford on a soccer scholarship. Cameron has had a troubled history in Port Charles and has been arrested several times, so maybe a change of scenery is best for him.</p><p>More recently, an NSFW video of himself and Joselyn was emailed by Esme (Avery Kristen Pohl) to his class and uploaded to the internet, publicly humiliating the couple, who has since broken up.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>On his final episode on General Hospital, Cameron had a going away party and surprised everyone when he arrived with Esme and her son Ace, seemingly forgiving Esme for what she did.</p><p>Compared to other soap actors, we have to say, Cameron's exit was pretty drama-free, unlike his co-star <a href=#>Marcus Coloma.</a></p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If leaving <a href=#>#GH</a> was William Lipton’s choice, Cameron should’ve been recast.
