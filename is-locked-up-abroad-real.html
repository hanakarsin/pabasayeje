Locked up Abroad takes the concept from Banged up Abroad (the name was obviously changed because that'd be an entirely different series here in the States), and applies it to cases about American-based criminals.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: National Geographic</span></figure><p>Usually the episodes either center on drug trafficking cases, but sometimes they include kidnappings and other traumatic experiences that happen to folks while they're visiting another country.</p><p>The show's setup is simple but effective. Each episode presents the individual who was "locked up," and they begin to relay their story.</p><p>The series' subjects start from the beginning of their tales at the onset of each episode. Whether it's meeting up with strangers in random minivans or attempting to traffic drugs throughout the country, the anecdotes are often delivered in very candid and matter-of-fact ways.</p><p>Since the situation is dramatic enough, there really isn't any need to sensationalize anything.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Missed last night's premiere?

Well, there's always room for some embellishment, and liberties are sometimes taken in the re-enactments of these types of shows by production or the narrator (in this case, the victim/perpetrators in each specific case), but it does appear that the National Geographic show only features true tales of overseas incarceration.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">One person who was featured on the show says that 'Locked up Abroad' is, for the most part, entirely real.</h2><p>Rob Pringle, whose own story about his very bad time in Peru, went on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit AMA</a> to interact with fans of the show and answer any questions they had about his experience.</p><p>Rob got pretty candid in the comments section.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dream adventures turn into hellish nightmares...

How didn't you give up hope?"</p><p>Rob responded, "The first time I chickened out and left the stiff there — got back and was threatened by cartel members — either sell some of my body parts, threats to my family if I didn't do another trip. Went again and was the fall guy.</p><p>"I did it for the money. In retrospect I believe that the first trip would have worked — everything was well 'oiled' — customs, etc. The second trip was never going to work.

The worst to me was that I was made to seem blasé about it when I wasn't, and unfortunately, the message that I tried to carry over, was omitted."</p><p>The worst part about Rob's experience is that he says while he knew he was being set up to take the fall, he knew that there wasn't anything he could really do about it: "It had become obvious that I was being set up, and this was reinforced by the constant attention paid to me and my not being allowed freedom to move around, the area where I was secluded, etc. I was also apprehensive as to what their reaction may be if I tried to refuse to do as they said."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuuM6cop6cXaq9bq3Bq6aanF2nsqK4</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
