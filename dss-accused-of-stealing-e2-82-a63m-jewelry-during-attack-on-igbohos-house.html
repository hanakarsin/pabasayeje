The assailants came around 1.30am, scaled the fence and opened fire.</p><p>“I think the instruction they were given was to kill every living thing sighted on the premises. A lady was the one directing them. She was calling occupants of the house by their names. That is to show that an insider gave them the information they relied on.</p><p>“They took away about N3m from his (Igboho’s) room as well as his jewellery.” the aide explained.</p><p>Another occupant of the house added that: “The&nbsp;assailants killed five persons and took away their corpses.</p><p>Some ladies, who are wives of chief’s aides, were also taken away. They took away the CCTV box so that we won’t play back.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the DSS has paraded suspects arrested during the raid on Igboho’s residence at its headquarters in Abuja.</p><p>The DSS spokesperson, <strong>Peter Afunaya</strong> while declaring Igboho as a wanted person, noted that the suspects will be charged to court when investigations are completed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49rZp2ro2KupK%2FUrJydZZ%2BberTAxJqjoqaXYnKGfoRxaV55Zmi6brbEsJylqqlisba%2ByKeeZpmkqa6kt4yopWahl5e8qbvSZp%2BoraOafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
