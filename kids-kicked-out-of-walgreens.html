Tray's son recorded the entire interaction, hence why it's all over TikTok right now.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@itsss.trayyy href=#>@itsss.trayyy</a><p>My son and his little cousin went to Walgreens to make a purchase before they could even get in the store good the manager told them to get out or she would call the police on them- (they are 11 and 12 years old, elementary school students) Racial profiling begins at a young age for African Americans - but you wonâ€™t get away with it- NOT on our WATCH! <a title=fyp href=#>#FYP</a> <a title=stopracialprofiling href=#>#stopracialprofiling</a> <a title=theseareourfuture href=#>#theseareourfuture</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - ðŸ©·Itsss_TrayyyyðŸ©·" href=#>â™¬ original sound - ðŸ©·Itsss_TrayyyyðŸ©·</a></figure><p>"My grandson came in here to purchase something, and what did you say to him?" the grandmother asked.</p><p>The worker replied, "I said he can come and purchase it right here with me, or he can leave because I've had a bunch of kids come in and steal." She added that she didn't assume the boys were shoplifting but still told them, "You can grab your stuff and come purchase it here, or I can call the cops, and you can leave."</p><p>As expected, the grandmother was furious.</p><p>"Let me tell you something. No, that's not it," she told the employee. "They have every right to come into the store and purchase what they want without being harassed by you. Why would you call the cops on children when they haven't done anything to you? If they were white kids, you wouldn't do it."</p><p>The grandmother told the worker to apologize to the boys and demanded the number for the store's corporate office so she could file a report. Once the employee went to get the contact information, the grandmother told the kids that they "have every right" to shop at the store. She also apologized for yelling in front of them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @blkmahogany228</span></figure><p>On Aug. 14, 2023, a Walgreens representative <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spoke out</a> in response to the viral video: "This team member has been placed on leave while we investigate the incident. We believe everyone should be welcome and treated with respect at our stores," the spokesperson said in a statement. "We take these matters seriously, and our policies strictly prohibit any form of discrimination or racial profiling, and any such incident will not be tolerated."</p><p>Many fellow TikTokers flocked to the comment section and shared their thoughts on the despicable situation.</p><p>"You go, grandma!! That was ridiculous!" one TikTok user wrote. "Hug them boys, they did the right thing by going to get you." Another said, "Yes ma'am, you handled that situation perfectly."</p><p>A third TikToker commented, "GRANDMA ATE. You can just tell [the worker] was scared."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @mysjhakenshayy._</span></figure><p>"Thank you, Grandma, for demanding justice. I'm sorry this happened," another person shared.</p><p>Someone else penned, "I am sorry that your little ones had to deal with that! That's not OK!" while another TikTok user sadly stated, "It's exhausting to have to keep going through this."</p><p>Others agreed that the grandmother held her own: "She handled well and spoke well!"</p><p>"Wow! Great way to advocate for those babies!" said another TikToker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLalv4ykoJyjlZl6sMHTZqafZaeWuai%2BxJ6lrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
